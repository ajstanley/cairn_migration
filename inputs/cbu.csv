Qualitative data (descriptions of classroom episodes in which participants experienced intense FLE and FLCA) was coded according to the source(s) of the emotion. Findings: Correlation analyses confirmed that FLE and FLCA are separate dimensions. Multiple regression analyses revealed that FLE was mostly predicted by teacher-related variables while FLCA was mostly predicted by the personality trait Emotional Stability. This finding was confirmed in the analysis of participants’ words. The most frequent cause of the FLE experience was the teacher while FLCA experiences were mostly frequently linked to the self.

Details of the molecular structure (i.e.\, functional groups) of cuticles are studied using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy followed by data evaluation using principal component analysis and one-way ANOVA test. Morphological changes as a function of different oxidative conditions are monitored by scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate that the geomacropolymers composing the cuticles of both taxa are chemically characterized by high contents of aliphatic compounds with relatively smaller amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons. The presence of considerable contents of carbonyl groups in the cuticles indicates likely ester chemical “bridges” that cross-link aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. These chemical bonds “strengthen” the molecular structure\, thus increasing the overall mechanical and chemical resistance of the cuticle. Conclusions include: (i) the cuticles of both taxa are extraordinarily resistant to extremely harsh chemical conditions\, which modified neither morphology nor chemical structure; (ii) independently of the oxidative procedure employed\, the two taxa cannot be statistically differentiated using the cuticular FTIR information; (iii) the high chemical resistance of the studied cuticles represents likely ecophysiological adaptations of the once living plants to survive stressful environmental conditions. They could have included high temperatures\, elevated CO2 concentrations\, seasonal drought\, and nutrient-deficient\, acidic soils exposed to intensive solar irradiation\, and eventual acid (H2SO4) precipitations. Chemical results are in agreement with taphonomic\, sedimentological\, paleopedological and (micro- and macro-) morphological data\, which indicate that the studied plants were likely opportunistic and stress-tolerant colonizers that dominated flood-disturbed\, waterlogged lowlands.\n\nThis combination of chemical and statistical tools enhances our understanding of the fine details of corystosperm cuticles regarding their structure\, taxonomy\, and paleoecophysiology.",,"cbu:1698,doi: 10.1016/j.revpalbo.2019.05.007,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034666719300193,cbu-school: Research Centers and Others,cbu-department: Biology",cuticular molecular structure--chemical resistance--dicroidium--johnstonia--chemotaxonomy--paleoecophysiology,"D'Angelo\, José Alejandro (author)",,2019-09,"Molecular structure of the cuticles of Dicroidium and Johnstonia (Corystospermaceae\, Triassic\, Argentina).

cbu:1704,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Literary Imagination--1752-6566--1523-9012,"Readers of The Merchant of Venice have long viewed the forced conversion of the Jewish moneylender Shylock as the most grave injustice of the play. Though no one suggests that Shylock should be allowed to kill Antonio\, and therefore Portia and the rest of the Duke are ultimately right to intervene\, critics frequently argue that when Shylock\, a legal “alien\,” is made to publicly revoke his most deeply felt beliefs\, the court has overstepped. The desire for kindness and mercy\, they argue\, has shown itself to be a ruse\, and has quickly given way to the imposition of the worst kind of revenge. Shylock\, by the end of the play\, staggers off the stage\, humiliated\, ruined\, and sickened. He disappears from the fourth act as a chastened victim of a society that has neither room nor respect for religious and ethnic diversity. Indeed\, in this view\, the so-called Christians of the play are both unfeeling and hypocritical\, for they pretend to the virtue of forgiveness\, but really practice the worst possible cruelty.\n\nTo subscribe to this consensus is supremely tempting because it agrees so fully with today’s values. And yet\, whatever our own positions on tolerance and diversity\, a close reading of both the text and its historical contexts reveals the consensus to be mistaken. Indeed\, the long-standing critical condemnation of the forced conversion oversimplifies and obscures the literary and historical complexities that this moment in the play invokes and upon which it reflects. Indeed\, it is much truer to both the play and its time\, to think of what Shylock is pushed into undertaking as a christening. The difference between conversion and christening may seem small; but like so much in the play and its reception\, a great deal depends on small distinctions. Christening\, in this play\, fashions a moral\, religious\, and social compromise that spares Shylock’s life while it contains his malice.",,"cbu:1704,doi: 10.1093/litimag/imz028,https://academic.oup.com/litimag/advance-article/doi/10.1093/litimag/imz028/5539499,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Literature\, Folklore & The Arts",merchant of venice--william shakespeare--theatre--early modern europe--judaism,"Pettigrew\, Todd (author)",,2019-07-26,The christening of Shylock,,"Journal Article,Text",,,,,27,ir:citationCModel

A sample of 181 older (over 55 years) Francophones from Northeastern Ontario (M age = 68.7\, SD 7.6) was recruited.

In addition to demographic measures the participants filled out a questionnaire that included measures of gambling behaviours and attitudes the Windsor Screen\, The Problem Gambling Severity Index of the Canadian Problem Gambling Inventory\, The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the CAGE Alcohol Screen. Contrary to expectations\, the Francophone sample had lower scores on the problem gambling measures with a smaller proportion of the sample in the categories indicating a high risk for problem gambling.

Exploring the tension between these perspectives\, the paper argues that any effective practical response implies and requires a change in the conceptual climate of the debate sufficient to discredit a literally devastating circular argument: that environmental problems\, caused in part by the multiple impacts of industrial militarism\, can be adequately addressed by new military strategies and spending\, a ""war reflex"" only serving to exacerbate political tensions\, widen and deepen already chronic inequalities\, and inflict further ecological harm. The paper contrasts the state-centric status quo with the human-centric agenda of sustainable peace\, a concept with the potential – if defined with sufficiently radical\, transnational rigor – to disrupt and transform the sovereignty paradigm.

Since it is based upon signal-prediction/cancellation principles\, it is referred to as adaptive prediction and cancellation digitization (APCD) method and is applied to various families of signals simultaneously received by a multistandard software radio (SWR) base-station receiver. It is shown theoretically and by means of computer simulations that the APCD method can effectively reduce-the high dynamic range of the signals before digitization takes place. Hence\, the stringent analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) resolution requirements imposed by the operation of such SWR base-station receivers can be significant relaxed. The signal dynamic-range reduction is achieved by applying appropriate signal processing techniques\, e.g.\, autoregressive (AR) and periodic autoregressive (PAR) prediction. Such techniques allow accurate prediction and subsequent cancellation of highpower narrowband signals present among the composite received analog signal. As these signals usually have cyclostationary statistical characteristics\, analysis and performance evaluation of AR and PAR predictors\, when used to predict cyclostationary signals\, were presented. A new adaptive algorithm for implementing the PAR predictor is also proposed\, and its validity is justified by theoretical analysis as well as by various performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulations.",,"cbu:745,citekey: Nie2006,doi: 10.1109/TVT.2005.863410,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Engineering","analog-digital conversion,challenges,cyclostationary signal,multistandard   base-station receiver,signal prediction,software radio (SWR),to-digital converters","Nie\, H (author),Mathiopoulos\, P (author)",,2006,Adaptive prediction and cancellation digitization method for wideband multistandard software radio base-station receivers,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,63,ir:citationCModel

This system is equivalent to the FPU-alpha beta system in a subset of its parameter space. We identify three distinct frequency regimes which we call the hydrodynamic regime\, the perturbative regime and the collisionless regime. In the lowest frequency regime ( the hydrodynamic regime) heat is transported ballistically by long wavelength sound modes. The model that we use to describe this behaviour predicts that as omega --> 0 the frequency dependent bulk viscosity\, (zeta) over cap(omega)\, and the frequency dependent thermal conductivity\, (k) over tilde(omega)\, should diverge with the same power law dependence on.. Thus\, we can define the bulk Prandtl number\, Pr(zeta) = k(B)(zeta) over cap (omega)/(m (k) over tilde(omega))\, where m is the particle mass and k(B) is Boltzmann's constant. This dimensionless ratio should approach a constant value as omega --> 0. We use mode-coupling theory to predict the omega --> 0 limit of Pr(zeta) Values of Pr(zeta) obtained from simulations are in agreement with these predictions over a wide range of system parameters. In the middle frequency regime\, which we call the perturbative regime\, heat is transported by sound modes which are damped by fourphonon processes. This regime is characterized by an intermediatefrequency plateau in the value of (k) over tilde(omega). We find that the value of (k) over tilde(omega) in this plateau region is proportional to T(-2) where T is the temperature; this is in agreement with the expected result of a fourphonon BoltzmannPeierls equation calculation. The BoltzmannPeierls approach fails\, however\, to give a nonvanishing bulk viscosity for all FPU-alpha beta chains.

As demonstrated in the text below and examination of WTC offers the opportunity to integrate psychological\, linguistic\, and communicative approaches to L2 research that typically have been independent of each other. We view the WTC model as having the potential to provide a useful interface between these disparate lines of inquiry. Our second goal is to suggest potential relations among these variables by outlining a comprehensive conceptual model that may be useful in describing\, explaining and predicting L2 communication. In an effort to move beyond linguistic or communicative competence as the primary goal of language instruction\, this article represents an overt attempt to combine these disparate approaches in a common theme\, that is\, proposing WTC as the primary goal of language instruction.",,"cbu:882,citekey: Macintyre1998,doi: 10.2307/330224,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Psychology","motivation,anxiety,foreign-language classroom,personality,acquisition,english,students,self-confidence,acculturation process,chinese","Macintyre\, P (author),Clement\, R (author),Dornyei\, Z (author),Noels\, K (author)",,1998,Conceptualizing willingness to communicate in a L2: A situational model of L2 confidence and affiliation,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,81,ir:citationCModel

This apprehension may intensify when participants communicate in the L2\, especially if they believe their level of L2 competence to be very low. This study examines perceived competence in an L2 as a function of actual competence and language anxiety. Thirty-seven young adult Anglophone students\, with widely varied competence in French\, participated. They completed scales of language anxiety and a modified version of the ''can-do'' test\, which assessed their self-perceptions of competence on 26 French tasks. They then attempted each of those tasks. We found that L2 language anxiety\, perceived L2 competence\, and actual L2 competence intercorrelated.

Variations in the mean scores of the items were more strongly related to the culture in a country and not to the language in which the data were collected. This was also supported by a multidimensional scaling analysis with standardized mean scores of the items from the GELOPH < 15 >. This analysis identified two dimensions that further helped explaining the data (i.e.\, insecure vs. intense avoidant-restrictive and low vs. high suspicious tendencies towards the laughter of others).

The purpose of this study is first to describe perceptions of driving under the influence of cannabis or cocaine among clients in treatment and\, second\, to assess whether these perceptions are related to the frequency of driving under the influence of cannabis or cocaine. Methods. A questionnaire was administered to clients in treatment for abuse of either cocaine or cannabis\, many of whom also had a problem with alcohol; additional groups of clients consisted of those in smoking cessation and gambling programs (N = 1021). Open-ended and close-ended questions were used to assess self-reported effects of cannabis or cocaine on driving and frequency of driving under the influence of cannabis\, cocaine\, or alcohol. Results. Two dimensions of driving behavior under the influence of cocaine or cannabis were found in both qualitative and quantitative analyses: 1) physical effects and 2) reckless styles of driving. Common physical effects for both drugs were heightened nervousness\, greater alertness\, and poorer concentration. In terms of driving behavior\, cautious or normal driving was commonly reported for cannabis\, whereas reckless or reduced driving ability was frequently reported for cocaine. When comparing negative physical effects and reckless style of driving with frequency of driving under the influence of cannabis or cocaine\, increased negative physical effects from cannabis were inversely related to frequency of driving under the influence of cannabis (p = .001)\, but other relationships were not significant.

Despite Canada's reputation as a bilingual nation\, nonimmersion students in this study would receive at the most only about an hour of second language speaking opportunities per day inside a classroom. However\, in reality\, the nonimmersion classroom tends to be structured so that emphasis is placed on grammar\, and very little L2 conversation takes place. Contrast this with students in immersion programs\, who are expected to use the second language inside and outside the classroom\, both for instruction and for social interaction at school. Immersion programs have been praised for the greater advantages they offer students\, and immersion students are often thought to be more proficient at using the L2 than nonimmersion students. At the time of this study\, there had been no research that directly compared high school immersion and nonimmersion students from the same linguistic landscape on non-linguistic language-related outcomes\, such as attitudes\, orientations for learning\, and communication affect. Such a comparison might have pedagogical implications\, especially for teachers who provide little opportunity for actual L2 use. The present study examines the nonlinguistic outcomes of an immersion versus a nonimmersion program. The dependent variables included attitudes toward learning French\, orientations for learning\, willingness to communicate\, communication anxiety\, perceived communicative competence\, and self-reported frequency of communication in both English (L1) and French (U). A qualitative section was included that asked students to describe some negative and positive experiences in speaking French and their reactions to these experiences. Compared with the nonimmersion students\, immersion students indicated higher willingness to communicate\, lower communication anxiety\, higher perceived communicative competence\, and more frequent communication only in the French language. Among the nonimmersion students\, perceived competence was strongly correlated with willingness to communicate\, but among the immersion students\, communication anxiety correlated most strongly with willingness to communicate. The obtained gender differences indicated that male nonimmersion students showed the least positive attitudes toward learning French; female nonimmersion students showed higher endorsement of 3 of the 4 language learning orientations.

This paper presents a new comprehensive classification of MPA benefits that will provide scientists and managers with an inclusive framework to accurately identify and account for all possible benefits derived from MPAs. The paper also analyses the methods available for valuing these benefits. A total of 99 benefits were identified within nine main categories: fishery\, non-fishery\, management\, education/research\, cultural\, process\, ecosystem\, population and species benefits.

cbu:651,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Ecological Informatics--1574-9541,"Marine reserves\, or protected areas\, are used to meet an array of biodiversity and conservation objectives. The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers\, The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network\, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used\, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves. In order to do this\, a simplified version of the marine reserve design optimization problem is considered. A Metropolis-Hastings random search procedure is introduced to systematically sample the model solution space and converge on an optimal reserve design. Incorporation of the uncertain input data builds on this process and relies on a parametric bootstrapping procedure. This allows for the solution (i.e\, the marine reserve design) to be expressed as the probability of any planning unit being included in the marine reserve network. Spatial plots of this acceptance probability are easily interpretable for decision making under uncertainty. The bootstrapping methodology is also readily adapted to existing comprehensive reserve design algorithms. Here\, a preliminary application of the algorithm is made to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (in the Caribbean Sea) based on satellite-derived and mapped conservation features (from Landsat).

Probabilities of transfers (connectivity) among 10 sub-domains of the BdOL are calculated from the statistics of the 3D particle trajectories and portrayed in a transition matrix.

The impact of this hurricane on the upper ocean of the MBRS is investigated using a triply nested grid ocean circulation modeling system. The model results are validated with contemporaneous ocean color data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite and oceanographic measurements in the MBRS. The nested grid system is forced by 6-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) winds for the first 294 days prior to the arrival of the hurricane in the MBRS\, and then by the combination of the NCEP/NCAR wind-forcing and an idealized vortex representative of Mitch for the following 20 days. The system is also forced by the monthly mean sea surface heat and freshwater fluxes and buoyancy forcing associated with major river discharges and storm-induced precipitation in the western Caribbean Sea. The simulated upper ocean circulation during Mitch is characterized by strong and divergent currents under the storm and intense near-inertial currents and sea surface temperature cooling behind the storm. The nested grid system also reproduces the buoyant estuarine plumes extending from the coast off Honduras as inferred from SeaWiFS satellite data and detected in field measurements at Gladden Spit in Belize shortly after the passage of Hurricane Mitch.

The BdOL comprise two major basins\, many deep and shallow bays\, several narrow channels and straits and a large\, geologically complex watershed. Predictive knowledge of the water movement within the estuary is a key requirement for effective management and sustainable development of the BdOL ecosystem. A three-dimensional (3D) primitive-equation ocean circulation model is used to examine the estuary's response to tides\, winds and buoyancy forcing associated with freshwater runoff in a series of numerical experiments validated with empirical data. The model results generate intense\, jet-like tidal flows of about 1 m s(-1) in the channels between the basins and connecting them to the ocean and relatively weak tidal currents in other regions\, which agrees well with previous observations and numerical results. Wind forcing and buoyancy forcing associated with river runoff play important roles in generating the significant sub-tidal circulations in the estuary\, including narrow channels\, deep basins and shallow bays. The circulation model is also used to reconstruct the 3D circulation and temperature-salinity distributions in the summer months of 1974\, when current and hydrographic measurements were made at several locations. The sub-tidal circulation in the estuary produced by the model is characterised by wind and barometric set-up and set-down in different sections of the system\, and a classic two-layer estuarine circulation in which brackish\, near-surface waters flow seaward from the estuary into the Atlantic Ocean\, and deep salty waters flow landward through the major channel. The model results reproduce reasonably well the overall features of observed circulation and temperature-salinity fields made in the BdOL in 1974 but generally underestimate the observed currents and density stratification.

The primary objective was to depict the spatial pattern of invasion of the rocky subtidal zone by an introduced macroalga: Codium fragile. The best classification results were obtained using the first three axes of a principal component analysis of all 19 spectral channels and the maximum likelihood classification of four classes of benthic community (i.e.\, those dominated by Codium meadow\, kelp bed\, Codium-kelp mix\, and sand) at three depth strata using an added bathymetry channel and no correction for water-column attenuation.

These investigations are supplemented by FTIR analysis of FCs and CCs of Cordaites principalis\, and a cuticle-fossilized medullosalean(?) axis. The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to try to determine biochemical discriminators between FCs and CCs of the same species using semi-quantitative FTIR techniques; (2) to assess the effects chemical treatments have\, particularly Schulze's process\, on functional groups; and most importantly (3) to study the primary origin of FCs. Results are equivocal in respect to (1); (2) after Schulze's treatment aliphatic moieties tend to be reduced relative to oxygenated groups\, and some aliphatic chains may be shortened; and (3) a primary chemical model is proposed. The model is based on a variety of geological observations\, including stratal distribution\, clay and pyrite mineralogies associated with FCs and compressions\, and regional geological structure. The model presupposes compression-cuticle fossilization under anoxic conditions for late authigenic deposition of sub-micron-sized pyrite on the compressions. Rock joints subsequently provided conduits for oxygen-enriched ground-water circulation to initiate in situ pyritic oxidation that produced sulfuric acid for macerating compressions\, with resultant loss of vitrinite\, but with preservation of cuticles as FCs. The timing of the process remains undetermined\, though it is assumed to be late to post-diagenetic. Although FCs represent a pathway of organic matter transformation (pomd) distinct from other plant-fossilization processes\, global applicability of the chemical models remains to be tested.

Further studies in support of (1)\, or (2) included methods of NICI\, SEM\, TEM and AFM\, and by EDS. Results indicate that the secretory organs occurred in the entire N. ovata frond\, its associate petiole and trunk\, and in great abundance on the pinnules of both species in a random fashion. Secretory products show layering effects\, surfaces can be intact\, convoluted\, folded\, or damaged. At 100\,000 magnification\, microstructures are not observable.

These changes can be correlated with pulses of tectonic activity (tectonic phases) resulting from the northwards migration of the Variscan Front. This tectonic activity caused disruption to the landscapes and drainage patterns where the coat swamps were growing\, which became less suitable to growth of the dominant plants of the swamps\, the arborescent lycopsids. They were progressively replaced by vegetation dominated by marattialean ferns\, which through a combination of slower growth and larger canopies resulted in less evapo-transpiration. This in turn caused localised reductions in rainfall\, which further affected the ability of the lycopsids to dominate the swamp vegetation. These changes were initially localised and where the coat swamps were able to survive the lycopsids and pteridosperms show little change in either species diversity or biogeography\, indicating that at this time there was minimal regional-scale climate change taking place. By Asturian times\, however\, the process had accelerated and the swamps in Variscan Euramerica became progressively replaced by predominantly conifer and cordaite vegetation that favoured much drier substrates. Except in localised pockets in intramontane basins of the Variscan Mountains\, the last development of coat swamps in Variscan Euramerica was of early Cantabrian age. Further west\, lycopsid-dominated coal swamps persisted for a little longer. The last remnants of the lycopsid-dominated coal swamps in the Illinois Basin disappeared probably by middle-late Cantabrian times\, as the cycle of contracting wetlands and regional reductions in rainfall generated its own momentum\, and no longer needed the impetus of tectonic instability. This tectonically-driven decline in the Euramerican coal swamps was probably responsible for an annual increase in atmospheric CO2 of c. 0.37 ppm\, and may have been implicated in the marked increase in global temperatures near the Moscovian - Kasimovian boundary\, and the onset of the Late Pennsylvanian interglacial.",,"cbu:612,citekey: Cleal2009,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology","nova-scotia,Vegetation,westphalian-d,south wales coalfield,bohemian shear zone,Climates,czech-republic insecta,Faunas,geological-nature-reserve,lower coal measures,paleozoic ice-age,Pennsylvanian Subsystem,saar-nahe basin,Sedimentology,tropical   rain-forests","Cleal\, C (author),Oplustil\, S (author),Thomas\, B (author),Tenchov\, Y (author),Abbink\, O (author),Bek\, J (author),Dimitrova\, T (author),Drabkova\, J (author),Hartkopf-Froeder\, Ch (author),van Hoof\, T (author),Kedzior\, A (author),Jarzembowski\, E (author),Jasper\, K (author),Libertin\, M (author),McLean\, D (author),Oliwkiewicz-Miklasinska\, M (author),Psenicka\, J (author),Ptak\, B (author),Schneider\, J (author),Schultka\, S (author),Simunek\, Z (author),Uhl\, D (author),Waksmundzka\, M (author),van Waveren\, I (author),Zodrow\, E (author)",,2009,Late Moscovian terrestrial biotas and palaeoenvironments of Variscan Euramerica,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,153,ir:citationCModel

The resulting steady-state (""climax"") coal swamp vegetation had a local-scale (within an area of c. 0.1 ha) species diversity in South Wales of 16 +/- 7 and Simpson Diversity Indices of 4.53 +/- 2.55\, which are very similar to values obtained from studies on North American coal swamp vegetation. landscape diversity (within an area 10(5) km(2)) varied between 50 and 100 species in the lower to middle Westphalian Stage\, falling to about 40-50 species in the upper Westphalian Stage. Regional-scale diversity (within an area > 10(5) km(2)) is difficult to estimate but was at least 120 species.

The base of the Cantabrian Stage is positioned in the stratotype at the base of the Villaneuva Marine Formation\, which immediately underlies the stratigraphically lowest non-marine strata containing Odontopteris cantabrica Zone macrofloras. The base of the O. cantabrica Zone is thus the effective index to the base of the Cantabrian Stage in non-marine facies. In the Cantabrian Stage stratotype\, this biohorizon is marked principally by the lowest occurrence of Alethopteris bohemica. In other areas\, however\, A. bohemica does not occur in macrofloras of early Stephanian age. Other biostratigraphical criteria have had to be used\, therefore\, notably the increase in abundance of Alethopteris pseudograndinioides var. subzeilleri and the decline in abundance (sometimes extinction) of Mariopteris nervosa and A. pseudograndinioides var. pseudograndinioides. A short distance above this level\, there is another and more distinct biohorizon (Biohorizon 3)\, which can be used as a guide to locating the base of the O. cantabrica Zone. This is defined by the stratigraphically lowest occurrences of Sphenophyllum oblongifolium\, Odontopteris cantabrica\, O. brardii\, and Lobatopteris lamuriana\, and the highest stratigraphical occurrence of Mariopteris nervosa. Biohorizon 3 also appears to coincide with first appearance of the relatively rare Schopfites dimorphus\, a marked increase in abundance of Thymospora pseudothiessenii\, and a lesser increase in abundance of Cadiospora magna.

Addressed are questions of variability (what is a coalified ovule?)\, comparison with petrified ovules\, pyrolysates and the original make-up of the grandis seeds\, and can similar chemistry proxy for organic connection between ovule and foliage? The results demonstrate variable preservation quality despite similar thermal-maturity levels in the geological interval in which the ovules were collected. Nevertheless\, the proposed T. grandis model is based on evidence from epidermises associated with inner and outer integuments\, and a two-layered nucellus with granulose exine that is covered by a diaphanous layer (tectum?) and nucellar cuticle. The latter separates the inner cuticle of the inner integumentary surface from the megaspore membrane.

In this interdisciplinary approach\, we study a ca. 300 to 350 mm long fossilized-cuticle-preserved frond section of M. macrophylla (Brongniart) that represents about one third of the length of a frond that was originally 1 m long. Size and preservation allow us to study the phytochemistry of the cuticle biomacropolymers over the length of the frond to assess what impact\, if any\, results would have on Carboniferous palaeophytochemotaxonomy. For comparison\, the phytochemistry of compressions with their extracted cuticles from the same species and the same sample locality is also investigated. We use solid- and liquid-state\, semi-quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for the chemical characterization of the frond.

Acitheca was an arborescent marattialean fern about 3.5 m high with large\, tripinnate or quadripinnate fronds which produced Caulopteris-like frond scars on the trunk. Although its reproductive structures are similar to those of Asterotheca Presl\, Acitheca differs in a number of characters of the sterile foliage (especially the venation)\, and its palynology. The veins fork at least twice (except in the smallest pinnules): after the first dichotomy\, the upper branch divides and then the lower branch divides\, producing polymorphopterid veining pattern. Synangia occur in two rows\, one on either side of the midvein\, and usually consist of four elongate sporangia that extend beyond the pinnule margin. Recovered in situ spores show a much greater ontogenetic variability than any other known Pennsylvanian marattialean; the size varies from 34 mu m to 116 mu m\, and exine ornamentation from laevigate (immature spores)\, finely microgranulate to scabrate (intermediate spores)\, to microverrucate-microgranulate (mature spores). Three species are described in the paper: Acitheca polymorpha (Brongniart) Schimper\, Acitheca ambigua (Stemberg) Nemejc\, and a new species Acitheca alii sp. nov.

It has extensively radiated within the tropics and subtropics of the Americas\, to which it is endemic. In this paper we present a synthetic overview of existing information on this radiation together with new information on estimated species diversity\, systematic relationships\, a species-level molecular phylogenetic analysis and preliminary macroecological and diversification analyses\, to serve as a platform for further study. We currently estimate that about 300 species (122 extant) are known from its 36 million year history but this number will undoubtedly increase as we extend our studies. We discuss the relationships of Polystira to other Neotropical Turridae (s.s.) and examine the taxonomy and systematics of the geologically oldest described members of the clade. To aid taxonomic description of shells we introduce a new notation for homologous major spiral cords. Focusing on key publications\, we discuss in detail the changing historical understanding of the taxonomy of the clade and the relationships of its component genus-level taxa: Polystira Woodring\, 1928\, Pleuroliria de Gregorio\, 1890\, Josephina Gardner\, 1945 and Oxytropa Glibert\, 1955. We designate a neotype for Pleurotoma (Pleuroliria) supramirifica de Gregorio\, 1890\, to stabilize our understanding of this\, the type species of Pleuroliria. Application of the name Oxytropa is restricted to the type species. The genus Polystira is conchologically re-described and for the first time we synthesize available information on the anatomy\, feeding and toxinology\, reproduction and life history\, larval modes and life habits\, and geographic and bathymetric ranges of its species. We give an updated list of the 19 formally described living species and present the pitfalls of the currently poor species-level taxonomy of Polystira using case examples. We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 22 extant species using three mitochondrial gene fragments (COI\, 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA). This reveals undescribed species and indicates that Recent genetic clades ('biospecies') are consistent with finely divided conchological 'morphospecies'. Historically\, there has been a slow realisation of the high species diversity of the Polystira clade and we consider that this may be due to inadequate precision of morphological description of shells and a lack of clear homology statements. We suggest how these both might be improved. Finally\, using a data compilation based on museum specimens we examine species range-size distributions and species abundance distributions for 85 of the 112 extant western Atlantic species that we have delimited to date. Our results indicate that the majority of species are rare and have short geographic ranges; only a few are wide-ranging and abundant.

To establish social structure among participants as a means of market building\, the NGO acquired relevant knowledge\, then used contextual bridging (transferring new meanings\, practices and structures into a given context in a way that is sensitive to the norms\, practices\, knowledge and relationships that exist in that context)\, brokering relationships along the value chain (facilitating introductions and exchanges between value chain members) and funding experimentation (providing resources to test ideas and assumptions about new market practices). Market participants themselves also contributed to the development of the market's social structure by means of social embedding (building relationships and negotiating norms of exchange and coordination)\, and material embedding (implementing technologies and practices and integrating market norms into technology).

Species richness was low with five earthworm species of the Lumbricidae recovered in the following order of abundance: Lumbricus rubellus\, Lumbricus terrestris\, Aporrectodea turgida.

However\, the CDHO lineshape meets the physical criteria of the imaginary components of these optical quantities and the Kramers-Kronig transformation. Modifications are presented that make the Gaussian and Lorentzian odd.

Respondents from a diverse\, snowball sample (N = 204) of musicians completed an online survey describing their hoped for\, expected and feared musical selves. Coding of the responses identified major themes. The 'hoped for' selves yielded four main themes among 171 responses: improvement\, social connection\, success and enjoyment. The 'feared' selves yielded a total of five main themes among 160 responses: being a poor musician\, injury/illness\, financial difficulty\, lack of knowledge and lack of social connection/recognition.

Nine new U-Pb (zircon) ages show that the former ""Cheticamp pluton"" consists of 10 separate plutons of five different ages: late Neoproterozoic (ca. 567 Ma)\, Cambrian-Ordovician (490-482 Ma)\, Ordovician-Silurian (442-440 Ma)\, mid-Silurian (ca. 428 Ma)\, and late Devonian (366 Ma). The three late Neoproterozoic granodioritic to monzogranitic plutons are older than the adjacent metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Jumping Brook Metamorphic Suite\, whereas the tonalitic to quartz dioritic Cambrian-Ordovician plutons intruded those metamorphic rocks. Petrographic characteristics and approximately 100 whole-rock chemical analyses show that with the exception of the mid-Silurian Grand Falaise alkali-feldspar granite\, which has A-type within-plate characteristics\, the plutonic units have calc-alkaline affinity and were emplaced in a volcanic-arc tectonic setting. These results are evidence that fragments of a long history of episodic subduction-related magmatism and terrane collision are preserved in this small part of Ganderia. Eight new Sm-Nd isotopic analyses are consistent with the Ganderian affinity of the Cheticamp plutonic belt. The ca. 490482 Ma plutons are the first direct evidence in Cape Breton Island for the Penobscottian event recognized in the Exploits Subzone of central Newfoundland and in New Brunswick.

Phenolic resins were produced in an autoclave with reflux times of 3\, 5 and 7 hours\, and by one-pot microwave synthesis at different power levels (176.364\, 315.092\, 453.820\, 592.548W) for reaction times of 15-90 minutes. UV-vis spectroscopy and FT-IR analyses showed similarities in the characteristics of the resins synthesized by both methods. Concentration of residual phenol in the products decreased with reaction time. For the conventional method the decrease in phenol after an initial 3hrs of reaction were 4.3% (in 5hrs) and 22.3% (7hrs)\, while in microwave synthesis at a power level of 176.364W and an initial reaction time of 30mins the phenol decreased by 33.05% (in 60mins) and 91.61% (in 90mins). At a power level of 315.092W and an reaction time of 15mins it decreased by 36.3% (in 20mins)\, 16.5% (in 25mins) and 10.8% (in 30mins). For resins from the conventional method\, melting points increased with increasing reaction time 83 degrees C\, 97 degrees C and 109 degrees C for respectively 3hrs\, 5hrs and 7hrs\, and between 95 degrees C and 103 degrees C for resins from the microwave method at various power levels and reaction times. The FT-IR spectra analyses for the products showed strong similarity in characteristics\, while the melting point data supported the GC-MS results that for the conventional method mostly the degree of polymerization depends on reaction time. The substitution of phenol with cresol results in resins with improved hardness and melting points\, but these differences were not obvious in the spectral characteristics. It was also observed that for the conventional heating method the melting points of the CF pre-polymers produced were higher than those of the PF prepolymers (119 degrees C and 127 degrees C for 3hr and 5hr CF). One-pot microwave synthesis was found to reduce the polymerization time significantly and produced resins with shorter gel times.

Consequently\, we investigated the pathways of excitation energy transfer ( EET) from successive light harvesting pigments to the low energy level inside the phycobiliprotein antenna system of Acaryochloris marina\, a cyanobacterium\, using a time resolved absorption difference spectroscopy with a resolution time of 200 fs. The objective was to understand the actual biochemical process and pathways that determine the EET mechanism. Anisotropy of the EET pathway was calculated from the absorption change trace in order to determine the contribution of excitonic coupling. The results reveal a new electron energy relaxation pathway of 14 ps inside the phycocyanin component\, which runs from phycocyanin to the terminal emitter. The bleaching of the 660 nm band suggests a broader absorption of the terminal emitter between 660 nm and 675 nm. Further\, there are trimer depolarization kinetics of 450 fs and 500 fs in high and low ionic strength\, respectively\, which arise from the relaxation of the beta 84 and alpha 84 in adjacent monomers of phycocyanin. Under conditions of low ionic strength buffer solution\, the evolution of the kinetic amplitude during the depolarization of the trimer is suggestive of trimer conservation within the phycocyanin hexamer.

Concentrations of PAHs were measured in surface soils\, marine and estuary sediments prior to and during remediation of the Sydney Tar Ponds (STPs) site which was contaminated by nearly a century of coking and steel production. Previous studies identified PAHs in surficial marine sediments within Sydney Harbour\, which were considered to be derived from STP discharges. Numerous PAH fingerprint techniques (diagnostic ratios\, principal component analysis\, quantitative and qualitative analysis) were applied to soil and sediment samples from the STPs and surrounding area to identify common source apportionment of PAHs. Results indicate coal combustion (from historical residential\, commercial and industrial uses) and coal handling (from historic on-site stockpiling and current coal transfer and shipment facilities) are likely the principal source of PAHs found in urban soils and marine sediments\, consistent with current and historical activities near these sites.

The research also seeks to gain an understanding of the relative importance of each of the selected factors in the research setting. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted in the Atlantic region of Canada. Questionnaires were mailed to key SMEs' informants. Data analysis was performed using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. A research framework based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) frameworks was used to guide the research effort. Such contingent factors as perceived benefits\, management commitment/support\, organizational IT competence\, external pressure\, information systems (IS) vendor support\, and availability of financial support\, were used to develop relevant hypotheses. Findings - The study's findings indicated that perceived benefits\, management commitment/support\, and external pressure are significant predictors of IEBT acceptance in the sampled SMEs; the results did not show that organizational IT competence\, IS vendor support\, and availability of financial support positively influence IEBT acceptance in the sampled SMEs. Practical implications - Policy makers\, industry leaders\, and small business operators wishing to understand some of the reasons why certain SMEs in the country lag in the adoption of IEBT and related technologies can benefit from the information provided in this study. The study also alerted the attention of local IS vendors and financial institutions to what can be done to strengthen IS adoption in Canadian small businesses. Originality/value - A handful of previous research in Canada has researched IEBT adoption; however\, some of these studies are dated. A such\, this current investigation of IEBT acceptance in a less endowed part of the country is timely and welcoming; it also serves to complement other prior studies in the country and elsewhere. A scan of the extant literature indicates that no previous study in the country has modeled some of the factors (e.g. the availability of financial support) as were used herein.

As a result\, the interplay between the surrounding medium and the closely excited adjacent cofactors is shown to be a negligible factor of the excitonic decay kinetics at 618 nm of the phycocyanin (PC)\, while it appears as a driving factor of an increase in excitonic delocalization at 630 nm. The obtained anisotropy values are consistent with the contribution of ionic strength in the excitonic mechanism in PBS. These values were 0.38 in high ionic strength and 0.4 in low ionic strength at 618 nm\, and 0.52 in high ionic strength and 0.4 in low ionic strength at 630-635 nm. The anisotropy value of 0.52 in high phosphate is similar at 630 nm and 635 nm\, which is consistent with an excitonic delocalization band at 635 nm. The 635 nm band is suggested to show the true low energy level of PC in A. marina PBS. The anisotropy decay kinetic at 630 nm suggests that the excited state population of PC is not all equilibrated in 3 ps because of the existence of the 10 ps decay kinetic component. The presence of the slow kinetic decay component in high\, and low ionic strength\, is consistent with a 10 and 14 ps energy transfer pathway\, while the 450 fs kinetic decay component is consistent with the presence of an additional excitation energy transfer pathway between adjacent alpha 84 and beta 84. Furthermore\, the 450 fs decay kinetic is suggested to be trapped in the trimer\, while the 400 fs decay kinetic rules out an excitonic flow from low energy level PC to allophycoyanin.

Optimal conditions for the growth and PAL activity of Rhodotorula glutinis cells and an improved method for the synthesis Of L-phenylalanine have been reported. A major problem encountered during these studies was rapid loss of PAL activity during storage of the yeast cells\, which were therefore unsuitable for long-term and repeated use. Enhancement of enzyme stability in the presence of various additives including polyhydric compounds and metal ions is described.

Graptolites\, the principal index taxon during the interval\, and a key proxy for studies of environmental and evolutionary change\, were particularly strongly impacted. Studying the extinction event is problematic. A disconformity or abrupt facies change occurs at nearly all global sections\, caused by the same mechanism believed to be responsible for the extinction: glacially-induced changes in sea level\, ocean temperature\, and ocean circulation. Until recently\, only South China possessed a well-sampled graptolite record of the LOME and its aftermath. Interpreting Chinese data was complicated by the lack of an equivalently rich and well-sampled comparison section\, which made it impossible to distinguish regionally unique patterns from sampling artefacts. \n This thesis describes a new global reference section\, located along the Blackstone River\, which holds North America’s only continuous graptolite biozonal record through the interval of extinction and recovery (ornatus to atavus zones). Intense sampling of a 50 m section identified 106 species of graptolites (described and illustrated with nearly 1000 photos and line drawings)\, including a number of taxa identified for the first time in Canada. This allowed highly detailed biostratigraphic correlation with China and other regions in the paleotropics. In addition to presence-absence diversity data\, all pre- and extinction interval samples were counted (>20\,000 specimens). This provided a test of sampling completeness in the present study\, as well as quantifying the impacts of sampling on apparent diversity. Abundances also illuminated graptolite population structure\, and demonstrated that community-level changes preceded the interval of peak extinction loss\, providing support for models of habitat loss and food-web based models of graptolite extinction during the LOME. \nWithin the post-extinction recovery interval\, the Blackstone River section boasts the world’s highest levels of graptolite diversity. These post-extinction communities were highly unstable\, with dominance fluctuating and high levels of species turnover. In addition to background instability\, a second extinction event\, previously observed in China\, but otherwise very poorly known\, occurs at the base of the Silurian\, demonstrating its global scale.

The specimen shows four orders of branching\, with each axis characterized by whorls of leaves having distinct morphologies. Foliage clearly displays a tendency to become less divided on axes of ascending order. Furthermore\, each branch order can be distinguished based on its internodal lengths and widths\, which indicates that the species has a marked hierarchy of ramification similar to that found in the calamitalean sphenopsids. Axes of all orders apparently show epidogenetic followed by apoxogenetic growth patterns\, which contributes to the high degree of heterophylly in the taxon. Comparison of axes and foliage of S. costae with other members of the genus reveals that sphenophylls from clastic substrates followed a fundamental ontogenetic pattern of growth and architecture\, although subtle variations existed between taxa. Climber hooks are documented for the first time in the species\, and the presence of these modified leaves supports the interpretation that S. costae formed dense\, multi-branched thickets up to 2 m high comprising mutually supportive axes that rested upon\, clung to\, or entwined with adjacent axes.

Often\, laboratory predatory stimuli also elevate plasma glucocorticoids\, which can then reduce brain cell proliferation. However\, it is unknown how natural predators affect cell proliferation or whether glucocorticoids mediate the neurogenic response to natural predators. We examined brain cell proliferation in six populations of the electric fish\, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis\, exposed to three forms of predator stimuli: (i) natural variation in the density of predatory catfish; (ii) tail injury\, presumably from predation attempts; and (iii) the acute stress of capture. Populations with higher predation pressure had lower density of proliferating (PCNA+) cells\, and fish with injured tails had lower proliferating cell density than those with intact tails. However\, plasma cortisol did not vary at the population level according to predation pressure or at the individual level according to tail injury. Capture stress significantly increased cortisol\, but only marginally decreased cell proliferation.

The enhanced DNA-loading capacity\, as demonstrated by a reduction in the number of ASMNPs needed to achieve complexation\, was presumably due to the elimination of DNA wrapping around nanoparticles and substantially reduced electrostatic interactions of DNA with nanoparticles because the compacted DNA globule conformation decreases its exposed surface charge. The maximum loading capacity of ASMNPs for condensed DNA was 4.4 times greater than that for elongated coiled DNA\, achieving the highest ever reported value of 385 mu g mg(-1).

Secondly; by using this new inter-cell interference model\, a theoretical analysis of the CDMA reverse link capacity is presented.

Steroid regulation of these signals can render them as reliable indicators of a male's physiological state. We investigated how plasticity in electrocommunication signals is driven by social competition for mates\, mediated by steroid hormones\, and subject to the effects of past social experience. We measured the electric waveform's amplitude and duration and steroid hormone levels of male gymnotiform electric fish (Brachyhypopomus gauderio) following week-long periods of social isolation\, and low or high social competition. To quantify the effect of social history on the modulation of the electric signal\, six groups of six males experienced all three social conditions but in different order. We found that males differentially modulate their electric signals depending on the order they experienced these conditions. Thus\, past social interactions affect both present and future social electric signals. Cortisol levels and the amplitude of the electric signal appeared to track the intensity of competition\, while androgen levels and the duration of the electric signal only responded to the presence (low and high competition) or absence (isolation) of a social environment (low and high androgens respectively). In addition\, cortisol levels were related to the body size of the males at high social competition. Taken together\, these findings suggest that the capacity of males to modulate their signals in response to social competition is regulated by steroids. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Although poorly documented in much of Atlantic Canada\, mass movements are known to have resulted in 71 fatalities in Newfoundland. In the Ferryland\, Newfoundland\, disaster of around 1823\, 42 fishermen were reportedly killed when a cave roof collapsed onto them. Debris floods and flows are widespread in areas of higher relief in both Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island\, and tend to be most hazardous for highway engineering and community development. Rotational slumps in glaciomarine clays are evident along the major river valleys of Labrador and are an important consideration during hydroelectric development. In other areas of Atlantic Canada\, earthflows affect transportation routes and involve movement of saturated sediment during spring thaw. Along the Gulf of St. Lawrence\, Northumberland Strait and the Bay of Fundy coastlines\, friable rocks\, glaciotectonic activity\, frost wedging\, and coastal erosion have resulted in many small failures and incremental retreat of coastal cliffs. Ongoing climate change will have an impact on slope failure activity. Increasing summer frequency and intensity of thunderstorms and hurricane events\, increased winter precipitation in some locations\, and possible erratic freeze-thaw events would result in an increase in debris flows triggered by precipitation\, and rockfalls triggered by freeze-thaw.

It is explained in various ways within scientific systems and in alternative ways of viewing resource allocation from that in neoclassical economic theory and its various prototypes. Complementarity among goods\, services and factors in neoclassical resource allocation is simply a localized phenomenon. Despite this\, bundles of similar goods collect together to re-establish marginal substitution with other bundles. In systems science\, the cessation of complementarity among variables causes the demise of process. Indeed\, the most significant influence of economic complementarity is to be found in decision-making systems. Here strongly interactive ethical principles showing pervasive and strong complementarity reveal themselves. Hence a knowledge-induced scientific methodology emerges. Yet these scientific dynamic methods that are merely premised on time-phase\, are found to be inadequate in explaining pervasive interactions.

Students rated their most preferred instructor (MPI) and least preferred instructor (LPI) on 11 common evaluation items. Pearson and partial correlations simultaneously controlling for six demographic variables\, Extraversion\, Conscientiousness and Openness showed that SETs were positively related to Agreeableness and CSE and negatively related to Neuroticism\, supporting the three hypotheses of study. Each of these significant relations was maintained when MPI\, LPI or a composite of MPI and LPI served as the SET criterion. For example\, the MPI-LPI composite correlated .28 with Agreeableness\, .35 with CSE and -.28 with Neuroticism. Similar correlations resulted for MPI and LPI. Hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated that the CSE was an independent predictor of MPI ratings\, Agreeableness was an independent predictor of LPI ratings\, and both the CSE and Agreeableness were independent predictors of MPI-LPI composite ratings.

Paper birch (Betula papyrifera)\, yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis)\, and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) were planted in a randomized block design under natural deciduous canopy and within small canopy gaps with a single application of lime and NPK at time of planting in 2003. Saplings were excavated in 2004 and 2008 for analysis of biomass allocation and testing of foliar N. In 2008\, mean survival rate differed significantly among species at 0.14 for paper birch\, 0.57 for yellow birch\, and 0.76 for eastern hemlock\, respectively. Yellow birch emerged as a species of intermediate shade tolerance associated with a sharp decline in shoot development after two growing seasons\, high leaf allocation of biomass\, and foliar plasticity. Foliation and physiological adaptation of leaves appeared N-limited in yellow birch. Biomass allocation analysis revealed strong allometric growth in yellow birch and eastern hemlock across experimental treatments imposed. Increased soil reaction from pH 4.7 to 6.3 following lime applications had no discernable effect on the juvenile growth and survival of the three species during six growing seasons. The experiment underlined the need for experimental testing of species under natural forest canopy.

Our reappraisal of C. valensis reveals it to be a small moradisaurine\, exhibiting a maximum of five rows of bullet-shaped teeth in the multiple-rowed region of both the maxilla and the dentary. The slightly radiating organization of the tooth rows distinguishes C. valensis from the parallel arrangement of the tooth rows exhibited by all other moradisaurines. Captorhinikos valensis is also distinguishable from the coeval moradisaurine Labidosaurikos meachami by a more conspicuously denticulated\, broader\, U'-shaped transverse flange of the pterygoid\, a plesiomorphic morphology shared with the large\, single-rowed captorhinid Labidosaurus hamatus. Postcranial information is limited to two short series of presacral vertebrae not associated with the cranial materials; open neurocentral sutures are present in one specimen\, indicating immaturity at death. We investigated the relationships of C. valensis to other captorhinids by adding it to the data matrix of a previously published analysis that included several moradisaurine captorhinids. A branch-and-bound PAUP analysis discovered a single optimal tree. Whereas a previous analysis of captorhinid interrelationships found the (undifferentiated) genus Captorhinikos to fall outside of a clade composed of L. hamatus and the large moradisaurines\, our analysis recovered C. valensis in a clade with the genera Labidosaurikos\, Gansurhinus\, Moradisaurus\, and Rothianiscus (i.e.\, Moradisaurinae sensu stricto)\, and Captorhinikos chozaensis as the sister species of a clade that includes L. hamatus and Moradisaurinae s.s.; Captorhinikos chozaensis is no longer classifiable as a moradisaurine (according to our phylogenetic definition for the group)\, and should be assigned to a new genus.

Pervasive pachyostosis of the postcrania probably allowed animals to maintain neutral buoyancy in the uppermost 3-4 m of the water column. Additionally\, such pachyostosis may have helped to control rolling at the surface\, or perhaps served to maintain forward momentum during periods of gliding while moving underwater.

On average\, individual fish spent most of their time stationary (67%)\, and substantially less time moving (22%) and tended to move up creek with flooding tides\, and down creek with ebbing tides. Higher movement levels occurred at mid-ebb and mid-flood stages when water velocity was at its highest. Eighteen individuals had tidal excursions either long distance movements with the tide or excursions onto the marsh surface or into shallow creeks at high tide. Individuals originally tagged in Spartina creeks tended to utilize only Spartina areas (12/13 tagged fish stayed in Spartina)\, whereas none of the individuals tagged in Phragmites creeks stayed in Phragmites areas (0 out of 5 tagged fish). These results suggest that the tagged individuals did not prefer Phragmites habitats.

cbu:238,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Astronomy & Astrophysics--A&A--1432-0746,"Context. Compact hierarchical systems are important because the effects caused by the dynamical interaction among its members occur on a human timescale. These interactions play a role in the formation of close binaries through Kozai cycles with tides. One such system is Tauri: it has three hierarchical orbits: 7.14 d (eclipsing components Aa\, Ab)\, 145 d (components Aa+Ab\, B)\, and 51 yr (components Aa+Ab+B\, C). Aims. We aim to obtain physical properties of the system and to study the dynamical interaction between its components. Methods. Our analysis is based on a large series of spectroscopic photometric (including space-borne) observations and long-baseline optical and infrared spectro-interferometric observations. We used two approaches to infer the system properties: a set of observation-specific models\, where all components have elliptical trajectories\, and an N-body model\, which computes the trajectory of each component by integrating Newton's equations of motion. Results. The triple subsystem exhibits clear signs of dynamical interaction. The most pronounced are the advance of the apsidal line and eclipse timing variations. We determined the geometry of all three orbits using both observation-specific and N-body models. The latter correctly accounted for observed effects of the dynamical interaction\, predicted cyclic variations of orbital inclinations\, and determined the sense of motion of all orbits. Using perturbation theory\, we demonstrate that prominent secular and periodic dynamical effects are explainable with a quadrupole interaction. We constrained the basic properties of all components\, especially of members of the inner triple subsystem and detected rapid low-amplitude light variations that we attribute to co-rotating surface structures of component B. We also estimated the radius of component B. Properties of component C remain uncertain because of its low relative luminosity. We provide an independent estimate of the distance to the system. Conclusions. The accuracy and consistency of our results make Tau an excellent test bed for models of formation and evolution of hierarchical systems.",,"cbu:238,citekey: Nemravova2016,doi: 10.1051/0004-6361/201628860,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology","binaries: close--binaries: spectroscopic--binaries: eclipsing--stars: kinematics and dynamics--stars: fundamental parameters--supernovae: individual: ξTauri,3-body problem,binaries: close,binaries: eclipsing,binaries: spectroscopic,eclipsing binaries,effective temperatures,orbital elements,prototype optical interferometer,speckle   interferometry,spectra,stars:   kinematics and dynamics,stars: fundamental parameters,stellar-systems,supernovae:   individual: xi Tauri,triple stars","Nemravova\, J (author),Harmanec\, P (author),Broz\, M (author),Vokrouhlicky\, D (author),Mourard\, D (author),Hummel\, C (author),Cameron\, C (author),Matthews\, J (author),Bolton\, C (author),Bozic\, H (author),Chini\, R (author),Dembsky\, T (author),Engle\, S (author),Farrington\, C (author),Grunhut\, J (author),Guenther\, D (author),Guinan\, E (author),Korcakova\, D (author),Koubsky\, P (author),Kricek\, R (author),Kuschnig\, R (author),Mayer\, P (author),McCook\, G (author),Moffat\, A (author),Nardetto\, N (author),Prsa\, A (author),Ribeiro\, J (author),Rowe\, J (author),Rucinski\, S (author),Skoda\, P (author),Slechta\, M (author),Tallon-Bosc\, I (author),Votruba\, V (author),Weiss\, W (author),Wolf\, M (author),Zasche\, P (author),Zavala\, R (author)",,2016,xi Tauri :a unique laboratory to study the dynamic interaction in a compact hierarchical quadruple system,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:238/datastream/PDF/download,415,ir:citationCModel

We show that our H alpha measurements are strongly correlated with the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope (MOST) photometry\, which led to a promising new method based solely on the spectroscopic observations. This new method\, which we refer to as the HH' method\, uses H alpha measurements as input into the FF' model.

Fourteen species of the genus Skrjabinoclava were found in the proventriculus (rarely the oesophagus) of 13 wader species. Seven species of Skrjabinoclava each occurred in a single host and three others were found only once or twice outside the main host. Only three species occurred commonly in several wader species\, mainly smell Calidris spp. Host distribution is apparently dependent largely on foraging behaviour and the availability of marine crustacean intermediate hosts. Some waders\, however\, may be refractory to infection. Individual species of gizzard nematodes (11 species in Schistorophinae\, Seuratinae and Habronematoidea) were not confined wholly or mainly to one host but occurred in different families of waders suggesting that they may use a range of marine crustacean intermediate hosts. Acuarioid nematodes in waders recently arrived in Iceland from Old World regions differed significantly from those found in the New World. This suggests that waders using different staging and wintering areas throughout the world may have more or less distinct species of acuarioid and habronematoid nematode parasites.

The suggestion that mesosaurs used their conspicuous dental apparatus as a straining device for filter feeding is based upon erroneous reconstruction of a high number of teeth in this mesosaur. Reinterpretation of the morphology and the organization of the marginal teeth of Mesosaurus suggests that they were used to capture individually small\, nektonic prey.

To compare nurses' caring expectations with their caregiving experiences and to identify factors that could potentially be included in a preliminary conceptual model of job satisfaction and compassion fatigue. Background. Nurses often report emotional reward and satisfaction in their profession from compassionately caring for sick and injured patients. However\, being in close proximity to trauma can eventually deplete a nurse's compassion and empathy for the patients they care for. This loss of compassion is further exacerbated by demanding work environments that involve administrative duties\, attending to patients' psychosocial needs and interacting with patients' families. To date\, the literature has tended to focus on pathology of compassion fatigue\, rather than identifying its contributing factors. Design. A grounded theory approach was used to identify emerging themes in nurses' accounts of their caregiving roles. Methods. Open-ended interviews were conducted with nurses (n = 9) who were employed by a maritime district health authority for a minimum of five years. Interviews focused on beliefs of how to provide care\, perceived caregiving responsibilities and perceived challenges in the provision of care. Results. Emerging from the data is a proposed model of job satisfaction. The concepts of monitoring and patient advocacy appeared to be key components in reported satisfaction or alienation. Discrepancies were found between care expectations outlined by management and nurses' perceptions of care provision. Additionally\, type of nursing education was related to nurses' confidence in applying nursing skills. Conclusions. These findings have implications for training programmes\, hospital management and quality of patient care. Relevance to clinical practice. It is important to identify factors that could explain resilience to compassion fatigue because compassion fatigue has negative consequences not only for nurses themselves but for the patients in their care.",,"cbu:377,citekey: Morrison2014,doi: 10.1111/jocn.12597,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Psychology","health,stress,resilience,caregiving roles,compassion fatigue,nursing","Morrison\, Kelsey (author),Korol\, Susan (author)",,2014,Nurses' perceived and actual caregiving roles: identifying factors that can contribute to job satisfaction,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,448,ir:citationCModel

To investigate this phenomenon\, we present MOST space telescope photometry of two Cepheids. V473 Lyrae is a second-overtone\, strongly modulated Cepheid\, while U Trianguli Australis is a Cepheid pulsating simultaneously in the fundamental mode and first overtone. The nearly continuous\, high-precision photometry reveals alternations in the amplitudes of cycles in V473 Lyr\, the first case of period doubling detected in a classical Cepheid. In U TrA\, we tentatively identify one peak as the f(X) or 0.61-type mode often seen in conjunction with the first radial overtone in Cepheids\, but given the short length of the data\, we cannot rule out that it is a combination peak instead. Ground-based photometry and spectroscopy were obtained to follow two modulation cycles in V473 Lyr and to better specify its physical parameters. The simultaneous data yield the phase lag parameter (the phase difference between maxima in luminosity and radial velocity) of a second-overtone Cepheid for the first time. We find no evidence for a period change in U TrA or an energy exchange between the fundamental mode and the first overtone during the last 50 yr\, contrary to earlier indications. Period doubling in V473 Lyr provides a strong argument that mode interactions do occur in some Cepheids and we may hypothesize that it could be behind the amplitude modulation\, as recently proposed for Blazhko RR Lyrae stars.",,"cbu:214,citekey: Molnar2017,doi: 10.1093/mnras/stw3345,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology","beat cepheid,classical cepheids,frequency-analysis,gravitational lensing experiment.,hydrodynamic models,large-magellanic-cloud,ogle-iii   catalog,rr-lyrae,stars:   variables: Cepheids,stars: individual: U TrA,stars: individual: V473 Lyrae,trianguli   australis,variable amplitude","Molnar\, L (author),Derekas\, A (author),Szabo\, R (author),Matthews\, J (author),Cameron\, C (author),Moffat\, A (author),Richardson\, N (author),Csak\, B (author),Dozsa\, A (author),Reed\, P (author),Szabados\, L (author),Heathcote\, B (author),Bohlsen\, T (author),Cacella\, P (author),Luckas\, P (author),Sodor\, A (author),Skarka\, M (author),Szabo\, Gy (author),Plachy\, E (author),Kovacs\, J (author),Evans\, N (author),Kolenberg\, K (author),Collins\, K (author),Pepper\, J (author),Stassun\, K (author),Rodriguez\, J (author),Siverd\, R (author),Henden\, A (author),Mankiewicz\, L (author),Zarnecki\, A (author),Cwiek\, A (author),Sokolowski\, M (author),Pal\, A (author),Guenther\, D (author),Kuschnig\, R (author),Rowe\, J (author),Rucinski\, S (author),Sasselov\, D (author),Weiss\, W (author)",,2017,"V473 Lyr\, a modulated\, period-doubled Cepheid\, and U TrA\, a double-mode Cepheid\, observed by MOST",,"Text,Journal Article",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:214/datastream/PDF/download,473,ir:citationCModel

Tracking distributions temporally requires an understanding of what species are currently present. Hydroids (Cnidaria\, Hydrozoa\, Hydroidolina) are conspicuous taxa in the fouling community of shallow water marine environments in Cape Breton\, yet surveys of them specific to Cape Breton are sparse and outdated. Consequently\, the identity and diversity of local species needs to be clarified. For this study\, hydroids were sampled from shallow water environments around Cape Breton and preserved for morphological and molecular analysis. Key morphological features including tentacle anatomy and arrangement\, gonophore anatomy\, colony structure\, and the presence of hydrothecae were examined for family and genus level designations. Sequences were generated for the 16S rRNA barcoding gene and used in BLAST searches to find strong genetic matches on GenBank. Molecular phylogenetic analyses were then performed to refine identifications and determine genetic relationships to other populations. The use of both molecular and morphological analyses has enabled the identification of thirteen taxa to at least genus level and eleven to species level. In total\, 14 out of 18 sequences strongly matched GenBank sequences\, with similarities ranging from 98%-100%. Two taxa\, Podocorynoides minima and Pachycordyle michaeli\, do not appear to have been recorded previously in the region. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic connectivity indicated strong genetic relationships with conspecifics in the United States and more distant relationships to conspecifics in Europe. Additionally\, it revealed potential cryptic species in Obelia dichotoma. Two genera\, Hydractinia and Sarsia\, have yet to be identified to species level. Having reliable morphological and molecular databases to identify species\, especially for Hydrozoa\, is important for monitoring changing distributions over time. This study represents the first stage in the development of a useful dataset for identifying local hydroids using 16S sequence data and accompanying morphological descriptions.","Cape Breton\, Nova Scotia","cbu:65,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology","Hydroids,Hydroids--Cape Breton\, Nova Scotia","Penney\, Matthew S.

This paper discusses how Haeckel’s contribution to spongiology was so distinct from that of earlier writers on the natural history of sponges\, by focusing on his “philosophy of sponges.” This included “an analytic” proof of Darwin’s theory of descent\, an argument for the monophyletic origin of the Metazoa from an ancient sponge-like embryo (the “gastraea theory”)\, and proof of the philosophy of monism that humans are no different than lowly sponges in their perfectly natural and material origins according to the laws of ontogeny in a universe devoid of supernatural beings or purpose. Haeckel was a philosopher using the methods of natural science. He was also a gifted artist—as his illustrations attest—and like most artists he disliked criticism of his creations\, including his theoretical work.

cbu:1632,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,PeerJ,"Shell aperture modifications are well known in terrestrial and aquatic gastropods\, with apertural lip thickening and tooth development common in species with terminal (determinate) shell growth. In contrast\, secondary shell openings are rare in snails and are largely limited to slit shells\, keyhole limpets\, and abalone of the Vetigastropoda. When such features occur in other groups\, they are noteworthy and raise interesting questions concerning the functional/adaptive significance of these shell modifications. Here we report on one such modification in a newly described species of vermetid snail. Members of the worm-snail family Vermetidae are sessile\, suspension-feeding caenogastropods found in warm temperate to tropical marine environments worldwide. As juveniles\, vermetids permanently cement their shells to hard substrata and subsequently produce irregularly coiled polychaete-like shell tubes with indeterminate growth and typically a simple circular shell aperture. In one previously studied group (genus Cupolaconcha)\, the aperture can be covered by a shell dome with a central slit that retains its widest opening in the center of the aperture. Vermetid specimens collected in the barrier reefs of Belize and the Florida Keys show an extreme aperture modification previously unknown in Gastropoda\, in which the shell opening is covered by an apertural dome that leaves two equal-sized circular holes\, each corresponding to the inflow and outflow water exchange currents of the animal’s mantle cavity. The function of this perforated apertural dome is unknown\, and it is in some ways antithetical to the suspension feeding habit of these snails. Further field and laboratory-based studies will be needed to clarify the functional significance and trade-offs of this unique morphology.

Research has indicated that adult athletes\, termed masters athletes (MAs)\, feel that coaches should orient their approaches differently when working with them as opposed to younger athletes (Callary\, Rathwell\, & Young\, 2015; Ferrari\, Bloom\, Gilbert\, & Caron\, 2016). Adults’ preferences for coaching approaches align with key learning principles of the andragogy in practice model (APM) (Knowles\, Holton\, & Swanson\, 2012). The purpose of this instrumental case study was to understand if and how each of the six andragogical (i.e.\, adult learning) principles were evidenced in how a 30-year-old female canoe/kayak coach described her approaches to facilitate learning with her MA group compared to those taken with her youth athlete group. Three semi-structured interviews\, each lasting 90 to 120 minutes\, were conducted with the coach. Field notes of learning situations documented during observation of separate MAs and youth training sessions informed questions comprising Interviews 2 and 3. Following deductive analysis\, the results showed that the coach’s approaches with MAs were largely andragogical\, especially in her ability to respond to adults’ inquisitive nature\, provision of self-directedness\, and recognition of the athletes’ intrinsic motives. The coach’s approaches with youth more closely followed traditional pedagogy\, whereby she directed information delivery\, limited the youth’s autonomy and decision making in training\, and considered more extrinsic\, competitive motives important to their commitment. Despite these contrasts\, aspects of both andragogy and pedagogy were evident in the ways the coach described her approaches with the two cohorts. Findings suggest that the APM in this specific sport context may be flexibly applied and its principles adapted in ways that respond to both youth and adult athletes’ learning needs depending on the situation. Discussion focuses on how the sport context may serve as an appropriate medium to make conclusions regarding the practice of adult learning.",,"cbu:1629,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Experiential Studies in Community and Sport,https://cjsae.library.dal.ca/index.php/cjsae/article/view/5424",,"MacLellan\, Justin (author),Callary\, Bettina (author),Young\, Bradley W.

The micromorphology and functional-group content and distribution of O. cantabrica are investigated by methods of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results demonstrate that the specimen is naturally macerated\, showing little or no cellular features.

We suggest that there are good reasons for language educators to engage in enhancing 21st-century skills alongside the promotion of linguistic skills. One key set of 21st-century competences that would have academic and non-academic benefits are those which promote wellbeing. Wellbeing is indeed the foundation for effective learning and a good life more generally. Drawing on ideas from Content and Integrated Language Learning and Positive Education\, PLE involves integrating non-linguistic and linguistic aims in sustainable ways which do not compromise the development of either skill set\, or overburden educators. We believe that there are strong foundations on which to build a framework of PLE. Firstly\, many language teachers already promote many wellbeing competences\, in order to facilitate language learning. There is also a growing body of research on positive psychology (PP) in Second Language Acquisition on which further empirical work with PLE interventions can be developed.

The manifestation of numerous pathologies in humans is considered to be intrinsically associated with microbial dysbiosis in the gut (i.e. a poorly balanced microbiota). Such adverse health conditions include obesity\, chronic fatigue syndrome\, cancer\, cardiovascular issues\, neurological disorders\, colitis\, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\, and rheumatoid arthritis. Endosymbiotic events at the single cell level took place billions of years ago\, eventually leading to eukaryotes\, photosynthesis\, and multicellularity. Macroalgae (seaweeds) were amongst the first organisms to develop these characteristics. Microbes and macroalgae interacted in a pattern of co-evolution\, a process that applies to most\, if not all living organisms. It is recognized that the normal human microbiome consists of over a trillion microorganisms\, including about 2 000 commensal bacterial species typically stationed in the gut. Many of these live in the colon\, where they function in the digestion of foods\, releasing bio-available nutrients\, bioactive molecules\, and various metabolites. They mediate communication signals between the gut and the brain\, and promote the normal development of immune function\, metabolic activities\, behaviour\, and neurological stability.

In this regard\, a targeted geological repository with a promising global storage potential is a saline aquifer. In these geologic systems\, decreasing water wettability due to acidity evolution following carbon dioxide injection will be the primary cause for its increased relative permeability or relative mobility. This increased relative permeability will increase brine fractional flow in\nsaline aquifers and\, hence\, cause efficient displacement and maximization of storage pore volumes.Decreased wettability will be due to the dissociation of carbonic acid in formation brine and increased hydrogen ion concentration. This dissociation will depend on the dissociation constant of carbonic acid at aquifer temperature and salinity.Therefore\, in trying to find optimum conditions of dissociation\, the temperature dependence of the dissociation constant is of prime importance. In this paper\, we have integrated theories of temperature dependent ionization of carbonic acid\, interfacial tension dependence on intermolecular forces and fractional flow to propose hypotheses regarding optimum geological conditions for sequestration.

This is particularly true for parasites with complex life cycles\, such as digenean trematodes\, that involve free-living and parasitic stages\, and have highly specific relationships with multiple hosts. Based on this\, parasites can play a role as bioindicators\, where loss of parasite diversity and changes in parasite assemblages can be indicative of degraded environments. In my study\, I explored the diversity of digenean trematode parasites associated with a well-studied freshwater snail\, Stagnicola elodes\, in Blacketts Lake\, Cape Breton\, in relation to another more pristine Cape Breton lake (Lake Ainslie) and to previous studies in North America. S. elodes specimens were collected from Blacketts Lake and Lake Ainslie\, and infected snails were identified by the emergence of cercarial larval stages. Cercariae were differentiated based on morphotype and behaviour and then preserved for molecular analyses. A DNA barcoding approach was used to assess species boundaries and to determine parasite identities\, where possible\, through comparisons to other parasite sequences on GenBank using BLAST. Following DNA extraction\, a 750 base pair portion of the Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I gene was amplified using PCR\, and then sequenced at The Centre for Applied Genomics in Toronto. Data were also supplemented with results from previous sampling years in Blacketts Lake. My results indicate that a minimum of 13 distinct trematode species channel their life cycles through S. elodes in Blacketts Lake\, spanning the families Plagiorchiidae\, Diplostomidae\, Strigeidae\, Schistosomatidae\, and Echinostomatidae. This assemblage of parasites overlappedwith those reported in previous studies that have focused on S. elodes\, however\, there were notable differences in the family composition between Blacketts Lake and Lake Ainslie. In terms of species richness\, that of Blacketts Lake was low compared to the pristine habitats of Douglas and Burt Lakes\, Michigan sampled in 1935-1936\, but similar to the same habitat following 50 years of human development. Trematode diversity in Blacketts Lake falls within a broad range of values found across other studies in the literature. My study establishes a baseline of the trematode community present in Blacketts Lake that can be used to monitor trematode diversity across years. Having a baseline may be particularly useful for comparing the health of the same aquatic communities over time or for comparing local environments that share similar habitats and climate\, but differ in potential human impacts. Further exploration of this trematode-S. elodes relationship within a given environmental context should therefore help to provide more insight into the faunal composition of aquatic communities and the integrity of these environments.",,"cbu:1638,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology",,"McPhail\, Brooke (author),(author),Rawlings\, Timothy (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,April 2018,An examination of composition and species richness in trematode communities using Stagnicola elodes,,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:1638/datastream/PDF/download,512,ir:thesisCModel

It may be argued that addressing both of these issues\, advancing Indigenous-Settler reconciliation and mitigating climate change\, can be done in the same space. Indeed\, though Indigenous peoples in Canada and elsewhere have recently moved forward with renewable energy initiatives within their Territories\, there has been very little critical analysis on just how such projects have been operationalized and whether renewable energy can or even should be considered a vehicle for reconciliation efforts. In this paper\, we present a systematic review of Canadian literature (spanning 1980 to 2017) concerning Indigenous peoples’ involvement in renewable energy in order to better understand the stated motivations and desires of Indigenous peoples in Canada taking leadership\, partnering in\, and/or participating in the renewable energy sector. Using a series of keyword search strings across three academic databases\, two theses databases\, and a grey literature search\, we retrieved literature (n=980) that was subjected to four exclusionary forms\, then thematically analyzed the included literature (n=26). Our findings suggest Indigenous peoples’ experiences and motivations are varied\, yet many are developing renewable energy in their Territories to break free of colonial ties and move towards energy autonomy\, establish more reliable energy systems\, and reap the long-term financial benefits that clean energy can provide. Despite the apparent advantages seen throughout most of the literature reviewed here\, we suggest further research in this area is necessary before this kind of positive rhetoric of renewable energy in Indigenous communities builds enough momentum that proponents become blind to possible shortcomings.

We examined the data of 673 older adults (M = 68.7\, SD = 7.6) from three different studies that used the same measurement instruments to assess demographics\, problem gambling risk\, and responsible gambling strategies (Norris & Tindale\, 2006; Thériault\, 2015; Tindale & Norris\, 2015). We failed to find any evidence that the use of responsible gambling strategies was related to the risk of problem gambling in older adults (as measured by the Problem Gambling Severity Index of the Canadian Problem Gambling Index and the Windsor Screen).

The present research tested the hypothesis that state resident neuroticism correlates negatively with state entry order. The hypothesis was derived from McCann’s residential mobility theory and based on restricted gene pools producing lower resident neuroticism as successive areas gained statehood. Spearman correlation confirmed that state resident neuroticism levels correlated highly (−.72) with state entry order. With state entry order transformed to a standard normal distribution\, sequential multiple regression showed that the relation could not be accounted for by recent state differences in socioeconomic status\, urban population percent\, White population percent\, Black population percent\, Hispanic population percent\, sex ratio\, median age\, or pathogen prevalence level. Supplementary analyses replicated the results with an alternate neuroticism measure and found that the other Big Five personality variables did not play a part in this context. The results are consistent with an evolutionary perspective. One common adaptive problem humans have faced repeatedly is residential relocation and migration. As with other adaptive problems central to important recurring situations\, psychological mechanisms referred to as adaptations have evolved. From this perspective\, personality differences are adaptations that reflect ways in which individuals characteristically deal with adaptive problems. They also determine which adaptive problems to confront or avoid. Therefore\, in different environmental contexts\, personality traits have different fitness consequences. Higher and lower neuroticism indeed appear to function as alternative strategies for solving the recurrent adaptive problem of residential relocation or migration.",,"cbu:1526,doi: 10.1037/ebs0000130,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/ebs0000130,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Psychology",,"McCann\, Stewart J.

The outcome of over two centuries of political\, economic\, and cultural interaction with Europeans\, this condition was exacerbated by the massive influx of Scottish settlers to the island after the end of the Napoleonic Wars - nearly 30\,000 between 1815 and 1838. With their lands occupied and access to customary hunting and fishing grounds severely limited\, the island's Mi'kmaw population - estimated to be about 500 in 1847 - adopted numerous economic initiatives to stay alive: they pursued agriculture and wage labour\, mobilized older skills toward different occupational niches\, and maintained\, at least to some extent\, customary rounds of seasonal resource procurement. This essay examines this evolving pattern of occupational pluralism\, and highlights how customary norms\, codes\, and behaviours provided part of the logic through which the island's Mi'kmaw people made decisions about what to do\, economically\, to survive.

Youth insights suggest that the downturn in the economy has had an impact on their families' ability to provide the traditional kind of support expected of working-class families. The resulting gaps in local cultural and social capital influence school successes and ultimately\, economic life chances for youth in already marginalized communities. Despite varying life chances\, all participants held similar perceptions of their community. Their shared views beg the question: can collaborations among fractions of young people strengthen efforts to advocate for social and economic security and comfort for all youth within and across disenfranchised communities?.",,"cbu:535,citekey: Brann-Barrett2011,doi: 10.1080/13676261.2010.532328,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-school: Research Centers and Others,cbu-department: Communication and Languages","education,transition,youth,family,chavs,post-industrialism,social class,young adulthood","Brann-Barrett\, Mary (author)",,2011,"Same landscape\, different lens: variations in young people's socio-economic experiences and perceptions in their disadvantaged working-class community",,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,547,ir:citationCModel

This paper illustrates that importance by attempting to correlate different types of evidence from the sites of Atlixco and Cuauhquechollan. Atlixcothe settlement referred to in the ethnohistoric sources as Cuauhquechollanwas occupied continuously from the Early Preclassic period to the middle of the Late Postclassic period (a.d. 1443)\, when it was relocated 20 km to the southwest (present-day Huaquechula). The new settlement retained the name\, Cuauhquechollan\, while Atlixco became referred to as Huehuecuauhquechollan (Old Cuauhquechollan). The evidence consists of a variety of ethnohistoric sources\, the archaeological record (settlement patterns and ceramic materials)\, and the iconography of Late Postclassic sculptures and carvings located in and around Huaquechula\, and in the immediate vicinity of the Valley of Atlixco. In spite of the limitations of the different types of evidence\, the findings suggest that there are sufficient points of overlap to allow for a better understanding of the importance of the Valley of Atlixco and to provide the impetus for further research.",,"cbu:314,citekey: Mysyk2015,doi: 10.1017/S0956536115000188,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: L'nu\, Political\, and Social Studies",,"Mysyk\, Avis (author),Morales Cano\, Lucero (author)",,2015,"The Ethnohistory and Archaeology of Cuauhquechollan\, Valley of Atlixco\, Mexico",,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,548,ir:citationCModel

More specifically\, with an ever-increasing number of tourists recognizing the attractiveness of the Arctic\, tour companies are increasingly recognizing the opportunities. The media (typically southern media) sells the image\, either before or after the tourists arrive\, and communities are often left to deal with the repercussions – whether those are social\, economic\, environmental\, or the like. Many of the repercussions are negative; however\, even when perceived as positive they can create tensions within small communities and showcase a variety of capacity issues.\nThis paper focuses on the realities and possibilities of tourism in the Arctic. It offers an up-to-date descriptive overview of tourism numbers and valuations. In addition\, ‘realities’ also focuses on the current suite of challenges and ‘possibilities’ addresses critical questions that need to be asked as tourism grows.

McLaughlin\, Joan Ormrod\, Laura A. Pearson\, Annick Pellegrin\, Mihaela Precup\, Jason Sacks\, and Ruth-Ellen St. Onge. This overview of the history of Canadian comics explores acclaimed as well as unfamiliar artists. Contributors look at the myriad ways that English-language\, Francophone\, indigenous\, and queer Canadian comics and cartoonists pose alternatives to American comics\, to dominant perceptions\, even to gender and racial categories. In contrast to the United States' melting pot\, Canada has been understood to comprise a social\, cultural\, and ethnic mosaic\, with distinct cultural variation as part of its identity. This volume reveals differences that often reflect in highly regional and localized comics such as Paul MacKinnon's Cape Breton--specific Old Trout Funnies\, Michel Rabagliati's Montreal-based Paul comics\, and Kurt Martell and Christopher Merkley's Thunder Bay--specific zombie apocalypse. The collection also considers some of the conventionally ""alternative"" cartoonists\, namely Seth\, Dave Sim\, and Chester Brown. It offers alternate views of the diverse and engaging work of two very different Canadian cartoonists who bring their own alternatives into play: Jeff Lemire in his bridging of Canadian/US and mainstream/alternative sensibilities and Nina Bunjevac in her own blending of realism and fantasy as well as of insider/outsider status.

Research has indicated that student misbehaviour\, often a result of disengagement\, is a major predictor of teacher burnout. In part to address student disengagement\, Hampshire County in England has undertaken a whole-school rights-based reform initiative called Rights\, Respect and Responsibility (RRR). This study was designed to examine the effects of RRR on student engagement and teacher burnout over a three-year period. The sample initially comprised a total of 15 schools (four infant\, five primary and six junior) and 127 teachers. At the second time of measure\, one year later\, the sample was reduced to 69 teachers from 13 of the schools. At both times teachers completed the following measures: the Maslach Burnout Inventory\, the perceived effect of RRR on teaching\, and student engagement. In the third year of the study we obtained data on the Maslach Burnout Inventory from 100 teachers at 12 of the schools. Findings suggest that RRR can improve student engagement and reduce teacher burnout.

Referred to as peer workers\, peer helpers\, or natural helpers\, people with lived experience of drug use leverage their personal knowledge and skills to deliver harm reduction services. Addressing a gap in the literature\, this systematic review focuses on the roles of people who inject drugs in harm reduction initiatives\, how programs are organized\, and obstacles and facilitators to engaging people with lived experience in harm reduction programs\, in order to inform practice and future research. Methods: This systematic review included searches for both peer reviewed and gray literature. All titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers. A structured data extraction tool was developed and utilized to systematically code information concerning peer roles and participation\, program characteristics\, obstacles\, and facilitators. Results: On the basis of specific inclusion criteria 164 documents were selected\, with 127 peer-reviewed and 37 gray literature references. Data extraction identified key harm reduction program characteristics and forms of participation including 36 peer roles grouped into five categories\, as well as obstacles and facilitators at systemic\, organizational\, and individual levels. Conclusions: Research on harm reduction programs that involve people with lived experience can help us better understand these approaches and demonstrate their value. Current evidence provides good descriptive content but the field lacks agreed-upon approaches to documenting the ways peer workers contribute to harm reduction initiatives. Implications and ten strategies to better support peer involvement in harm reduction programs are identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Semistructured interviews ascertained coaches' perceptions of and experiences with the LTAD model in their coaching practice. Coaches adhered to the global vision and general principles of LTAD. However\, several barriers to LTAD adoption and implementation were identified. A mismatch between the model's long-term and the short-term visions of results in sport was perceived as deterrent to LTAD adoption and implementation. Coaches involved in early development sports mentioned a lack of compatibility of LTAD with the demands of their sport.

These Arctic Observation Systems (AOS) contribute to the planning\, implementation\, monitoring and evaluation of environmental change and responsible social and economic development in the Arctic. The aim of this article is to identify the two-way relationship between AOS and tourism. On the one hand\, tourism activities account for diverse changes across a broad spectrum of impact fields. On the other hand\, due to its multiple and diverse agents and far-reaching activities\, tourism is also well-positioned to collect observational data and participate as an actor in monitoring activities. To accomplish our goals\, we provide an inventory of tourism-embedded issues and concerns of interest to AOS from a range of destinations in the circumpolar Arctic region\, including Alaska\, Arctic Canada\, Iceland\, Svalbard\, the mainland European Arctic and Russia.

Focused interviews were conducted in Spanish to determine the workers' perspectives on their experiences of nervios while residing in rural\, southwest Ontario. Data for analysis originated from variables created to represent key themes that had emerged from open coding of the interviews. Simultaneous entry\, multiple regression analyses revealed that provocation\, control salience\, and cognitive sensory motor distress directly explained 67.2% of the variation in worker expressions of negative affectivity. The combination fear\, feeling trapped\, and giving in mediated the relationship of provocation\, control salience and cognitive sensory motor distress to expressions of negative affectivity (R-2 = 88.1%). Control salience and its dampening effect on other elements of the nervios experience\, however\, appeared to be key to whether subjects experienced negative reactions to being provoked or distressed. This evidence points to nervios being a powerful\, holistic idiom of distress with at least six variables contributing to its affective negativity.

Because both components are slow rotators\, the minimum masses of the components are known with 0.2% precision from spectroscopy. The system seems ideal for very precise mass\, radius\, and luminosity determinations and\, owing to its proximity and long orbital period (~34.8 days)\, promises to be resolved with long-baseline interferometry.\n\nAims. The principal aim is very accurate determinations of absolute stellar parameters for both components of the eclipsing binary and a model-independent determination of the distance.\n\nMethods. New high-precision photometry of both eclipses of V923 Sco with the MOST satellite was obtained. The system was spatially resolved with the VLTI AMBER\, PIONIER\, and GRAVITY instruments at nine epochs. Combining the projected size of the spectroscopic orbit (in km) and visual orbit (in mas) the distance to the system is derived. Simultaneous analysis of photometric\, spectroscopic\, and interferometric data was performed to obtain a robust determination of the absolute parameters.\n\nResults. Very precise absolute parameters of the components were derived in spite of the parameter correlations. The primary component is found to be overluminous for its mass. Combining spectroscopic and interferometric observations enabled us to determine the distance to V923 Sco with better than 0.2% precision\, which provides a stringent test of Gaia parallaxes.\n\nConclusions.

However\, the use of seaweed extracts for their beneficial properties\, as applied to marine macroalgae\, only began in the mid to late 2000s. Kappaphycus alvarezii is an important red seaweed on the coasts of tropical to sub-tropical waters\, mainly because of the various applications of kappa carrageenan\, which is the major industrial colloid extracted from this extensively cultivated biomass. Cultivation of this seaweed has brought economic benefits to tens of thousands of seaweed farmers in Southeast Asia and other minor producing countries. Recently\, Ascophyllum (aka. Acadian) Marine Plant Extract Powder (AMPEP)\, a commercial seaweed extract from the brown intertidal\, macroalga A. nodosum was used in steps taken during the micropropagation and field cultivation of K. alvarezii. The reasons for utilizing this treatment included addressing the current problems facing the industry\, such as decreased productivity\, loss of vigor and diminished crop quality. This was brought about by shortages in the availability of good quality propagules (seedlings) and also disease and endo-epiphyte infestations\, which affected the ability to grow and harvest saleable biomass\, thus decreasing the income\, and therefore the interest and participation of the potential seaweed farmers (based on the factor of repetitive\, “drudge” labor and their derived income per unit effort). This paper reviews studies on Kappaphycus including the use of AMPEP specifically and also some alternative extracts to mitigate both biotic and abiotic stressors\, using examples from micropropagation\, field cultivation\, endophyte mitigation and impacts on the resulting carrageenan qualities. Taken together\, this body of evidence provides proof of concept and very promising results which may lead to further studies more specifically to identify the modes of action and the metabolic pathways by which the complex AMPEP extract might improve stress tolerances in K. alvarezii in order to obtain higher productivity and enhanced quality characteristics (i.e.\, exposure to increasing surface seawater temperature\, salinity fluctuations and photo-inhibitory irradiance as well as attacks by pathogenic and opportunistic organisms).",,"cbu:1579,doi: 10.1007/s10811-018-1407-4,http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10811-018-1407-4,cbu-school: Research Centers and Others,cbu-department: Verschuren Centre",,"Hurtado\, Anicia Q.

This study combines energetic modelling using Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory with acoustic telemetry to mechanistically link smolt bioenergetics to their migration strategy within the Bras d’Or. This study examines two main questions: 1) what is the relationship between smolts’ bioenergetics and smolts’ migration strategy\, and 2) what effect would warmer water temperature have on smolts’ energetic requirements?

Motivation for music is complex\, blending relatively intrinsic and extrinsic motives. The purpose of this study is to investigate the motivation of musicians by considering how different aspects of motivational features interact. An international sample of 188 musicians was obtained through the use of an online survey. Four scales drawn from Self-Determination Theory (intrinsic\, identified\, introjected\, and extrinsic regulation) were utilized along with other motivational constructs\, including motivational intensity\, desire to learn\, willingness to play\, perceived competence\, and musical self-esteem. To integrate the variables into a proposed model\, a path analysis was conducted among the motivation variables. Results showed that the intrinsic motives are playing the major role in the maintenance of the motivational system\, while extrinsic motives are less influential. Support was found for a feedback loop\, whereby desire to learn feeds into increased effort at learning (i.e.\, motivational intensity)\, leading to the development of perceived competence\, which is then reflected back into increasing desire to learn.

It explores the prevalence of PTSD and depression as well as the lack of support systems for those living with these illnesses in Sydney\, Nova Scotia. Available literature has presented the notion that these illnesses go hand in hand\, becoming extremely prevalent in veterans due to heightened exposure to traumatic events. This prevalence\, and the lack of impartial research done in the area of military service and mental health have fueled the present research study. The research question is as follows\, “Does the amount of mental health support in the CBRM meet the needs of military veterans post-service?” Veterans participated in one-on-one semi structured interviews covering topics including community\, available mental health infrastructure\, and the degree to which health organizations are deemed to be “successful” in providing services. Results indicated that the availability and success of the infrastructure throughout the province is disproportionate; places such as the\nCBRM are lacking\, while the HRM is adequately providing. Stemming from this lack of support\, participants felt disconnected from their place of residence and within the veteran community. Organizations that have shown success have been taken off the map\, and replaced with government run organizations\, which has led to discouragement. Taken as a whole\, results of the present research study indicate that receiving adequate support is often a product of mere chance. As stated by the literature\, providing information on mental health infrastructure and developing a deeper understanding of the needs proposed by CAF are essential for efficient service planning\, providing access\, and creating positive changes in communities.

In the regions\, most intensely engaged in this form of employment\, mobile oil work has largely replaced the dominant industries of the previous century. This geographic shift in Canadian investment and production has created uneven labour markets\, with high demand for labour in the Northern Alberta and high unemployment in de-industrialized communities in Atlantic Canada. (2) Methods: There is little quantitative evidence on the flows of mobile workers from the East to the West and the impact of this movement on the Atlantic Canadian economy. Data for this paper were obtained through a special arrangement with Statistics Canada in the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016\, from the Canadian Employer–Employee Dynamics Database (CEEDD). (3) Results: Analysis of CEEDD revealed that the oil and gas industry of Northern Alberta has a significant impact on the economies of Atlantic Canada with an increasing dependence for interprovincial workers. (4) Conclusions: To the extent that mobile work has served as a replacement for traditional industries\, mobile work is re-structuring the social and economic makeup of Atlantic Canadian communities. The more reliant Atlantic Canadian communities become on oil-related mobile work\, the more precarious their economies will become as global markets for oil and gas change and targeted actions on climate change increase",,"cbu:1850,doi: 10.3390/soc10010011,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/10/1/11,cbu-school: Shannon School of Business,cbu-department: MBA",migrant labour--economic dependence--Atlantic Canada--Alberta--oil and gas--employment patterns--climate change,"Lionais\, Doug (author),Murray\, Christina (author),Donatelli\, Chloe (author)",,2020-01-19,Dependence on interprovincial migrant labour in atlantic Canadian communities: The role of the Alberta economy,,"Journal Article,Text",,,,,633,ir:citationCModel

In attempts to beneficially impact the soil microbiota\, biochar of two different particle sizes were inoculated with plant growth promoting bacteria and introduced into the rhizosphere soil of barley. Control and experimental pots of barley were grown and monitored in a greenhouse for 9 weeks prior to harvest and analysis of growth traits. In general\, yields of barley improved by at least 54% when coarse biochar was inoculated with bacteria (p = 0.113)\, compared to uninoculated coarse biochar or no biochar controls. In contrast\, fine biochar performed significantly better without a microbial partner (p = 0.028). Significant changes in soil pH were detected (p = 0.020–0.068) in some of the treatments correlating with the different pH levels of the respective biochars. While both the fine biochar and the Fictibacillus-inoculated coarse biochar gave similarly large increases in fruit:shoot ratios in the barley\, it was noted that the fine biochar is more difficult to handle and can pose an inhalation hazard when dry.

Thus\, a reductive degradation procedure of anthracene using activated magnesium with anhydrous ethanol at room temperature was developed and optimized. To determine the optimum conditions for anthracene\, such as effective magnesium concentrations\, glacial acetic acid volumes\, and exposure time for the anthracene reduction\, the experiments were designed using the response surface methodology based on the central composite design. The design also minimized the number of experiments. The main product from anthracene reduction is 9\,10-dihyrdoanthracene. Optimum conditions for 98% degradation capacity of anthracene (2.80 × 10–3 mmol) were 30 mg of Mg powder (1.20 mmol)\, 60 μL of glacial acetic acid (1.05 mmol)\, and 30 min exposure time. When the optimized method was tested on the coal tar specimen\, twice as many reagents (i.e.\, Mg and glacial acetic acid) were required to obtain a 90% degradation of anthracene and fluoranthene from the coal tar.

Each validation site was further subjected to 3 levels of simulated degradation based on the sensitivity of the biota to eutrophication. The analytical approaches ranged from standard or slight modifications of methods used in national programs (Australian River Assessment [AUSRIVAS]\, Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network [CABIN])\, to improved matching of sites to be assessed and appropriate reference sites\, and Bayesian and machine-learning modeling. In comparing Type 1 error rates (proportion of validation sites deemed not in reference condition) and power (proportion of simulated impairment sites deemed not in reference condition)\, we found no obvious pattern among the 3 data sets or approaches.

By applying Schulze's maceration process to the fossil foliage to obtain the cuticles\, five sample forms evolved\, viz. compressions\, cuticles and fossilized cuticles\, and acidic and alkaline solutions from Schulze's process\, to which was added the Sydney coal samples as the sixth form. Area integration of the absorbance spectra from solid and liquid state Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\, produced functional chemical parameters which were organized into a data matrix of eight variables and 62 samples (8 x 62 matrix). Since we were interested in grouping the sample forms as a function of phytochemistry (functional groups) to assess primarily the palaeophytotaxonomic potential as a general approach to Carboniferous taxonomy\, principal components were extracted from the matrix\, and a subset of 4 x 33 samples in order to refine the grouping results from the initial component analysis.

Both tests were significant predictors of achievement in both grades. These findings show that the Boehm test has utility as a predictor of reading achievement and as a practical alternative to readiness tests. Current tests of reading readiness tend to assess skills basically related to what might be called the mechanics of reading; tasks such as visual discrimination\, auditory discrimination\, auditory blending\, letter recognition\, etc.\, are frequently used. Although subtests measuring more general comprehension or cognitive abilities are sometimes included (e.g.\, listening comprehension or following directions)\, they usually constitute only a minor portion of the test. For many children who experience difficulty with reading\, the problem may lie less with deficits in ""mechanical"" reading skills than with lack of comprehension of basic concepts. Such a problem would be compounded as more difficult concepts are encountered in reading materials at higher levels. Measures of knowledge of basic concepts might predict reading achievement as well as or even better than reading-readiness test scores\, particularly in later grades. Indeed\, the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts ( 1) has been described as a significant predictor of various aspects of academic achievement\, including reading achievement\, in Grades 1 (2\, 3\, 6)\, 2\, and 3 (7).

Whole cells of various Rhodotorula yeast strains showed low levels of PAL activity on account of membrane permeability barriers for the substrate\, L-phenylalanine. Different methods of enriching PAL activity including ultra-sonication\, detergent and enzyme solubilization were investigated in this study in an effort to overcome these permeability barriers. Ultra-sonication of the yeast cells was found to be the most effective of the methods and yielded over 10-fold higher enzyme activity as compared to untreated whole cells. Solubilization of the yeast cells involving a synergistic treatment with Triton-X-100 and glucuronidase gave about nine-fold enrichment while cells treated individually with Triton-X-100\, glucuronidase and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide gave 6.8\, 5.9-and 5.8-fold higher activity\, respectively.

Results: Children with dyslexia showed atypical N400 ERP waveforms to both types of phonological mismatches\, but not to phonologically unrelated mismatches\, reflecting a relative insensitivity to phonological overlap among auditory words.

For benzene-d(6) and benzene-d(1)\, the absolute intensities were reported as spectra and tables of the real and imaginary refractive indices\, and as spectra of the molar absorption coefficient and the imaginary molar polarizability (alpha(m)(n)) under the Lorentz local field. Further\, the contributions from the different bands to the imaginary molar polarizability spectrum below 5000 cm(-1) were separated by fitting the spectrum with Classical Damped Harmonic Oscillator (CDHO) bands. The integrated intensities C-j were then obtained from the parameters of the CDHO bands as the areas under the corresponding (v) over tilde alpha(m)(n) bands. The integrated intensities gave the transition dipole moments and also\, for the fundamentals that are infrared-active in the gas phase\, the dipole moment derivatives with respect to the normal coordinates under the double harmonic approximation. The present paper completes the experimental study of benzene-h(6) by presenting the results of the following work. The imaginary refractive index spectrum Of C6H6 was extended to 11.5 cm(-1) from its previous lower limit of 500 cm(-1). The real refractive index spectrum between 8000 and 11.5 cm(-1) was obtained by Kramers-Kronig transformation of the imaginary refractive index spectrum. It agrees excellently with the real refractive index spectrum directly measured below 100 cm(-1)\, which suggests that the accuracy of the k spectrum is very good\, particularly at low wavenumbers. The imaginary molar polarizability spectrum Of C6H6 between 6200 and 11.5 cm(-1) was calculated from the n and k spectra and was fitted with 226 CDHO bands and 1 Gaussian band. No baseline was required in the fit and the baseline absorption was described accurately by the bands used. The integrated intensity\, C-j\, of each band used to fit the spectrum was calculated analytically from the band's parameters. The transition dipole moments were then calculated for the clearly assigned transitions. and the dipole moment derivatives with respect to the normal coordinates were calculated under the double harmonic approximation for the fundamentals that are infrared-active in the gas phase.

Economics is treated as a parallel case study in this respect. It is shown that the field of Western social sciences was the outcome of the revolt against the Church in the eighteenth century by the scholastic school to sever science from religion. Ever since\, it has gained momentum also under the Cartesian philosophy of empiricism. Thus\, the age‐long advance of the social sciences has shown increasing independence within each of its sub‐disciplines. An inward looking hegemony developed among the various sub‐disciplines. Such developments have made it increasingly difficult for the treatment of ethics and values as integrable elements in social investigation. The essence of a human analysis of social problems is thereby\, misunderstood in modern social science analysis. The philosophy\, nature and methodology of social investigation in Islamic framework are examined. It is argued that the Western concern with dichotomy between science and religion is not applicable to Islam. Consequently\, there is a good possibility for studying social problems by an integrated approach among all the sub‐disciplines of the social sciences. This gives rise to an interdisciplinary study of social issues and problems and the development of a generalised social equilibrium system in the Islamic framework. We have developed one such comprehensive model endowed by its intrinsic Islamic ethics and values emanating fundamentally from the dynamic Quranic essence of the Unity of God in the working of the universe\, “Al‐Tawhid”. The key principles and instruments are developed. The central role of the “shura” in functionally endowing the integrated study of social issues\, is studied. In this context\, the study of Islamic economics as one of Islamic political economy is examined. A specific economic problem in this area is explored.

Through a series of in-depth interviews with individuals from the investment community\, device developers and industry support\, the research seeks to identify common barriers and incentives to investment.

Diversity levels tracked changes in sea level and water mass properties\, with extinction associated with sea level fall and increased oxygenation\, and rediverficiation associated with post-glacial flooding and a return to black shale deposition in the late Hirnantian. New data from the Blackstone River\, Yukon\, shows that graptolite diversity rebounded there to near pre-extinction maximum levels in the latest Ordovician persculptus Zone\, before dramatically dropping at the Ordovician-Silurian boundary (from 16 to 6 species). Diversity levels rapidly recovered in the basal Silurian (ascensus Zone)\, but with almost no carry-over in taxa.

Research in recent decades has revealed an unappreciated ecological diversity in addition to taxonomic richness of Early Permian reptiles and recognition of a radiation of Palaeozoic-Triassic forms now known as parareptiles. Perhaps the most unusual parareptile to be described from the Permian Basin of North America is the lanthanosuchoid Colobomycter pholeter from the Richards Spur locality\, Oklahoma\, USA. Although initially described as a synapsid\, this species was later reassigned to Parareptilia. Colobomycter is very distinct from all other known parareptiles\, and coeval tetrapods in general\, largely due to its extremely conspicuous and unique marginal dentition. The single\, very large anteriormost tooth of the premaxilla and the paired enlarged teeth of the maxilla characterize the dentition of Colobomycter. Herein we describe new cranial material of C. pholeter that reveals previously unknown aspects of the skull and further increases our anatomical knowledge of this unique taxon. The new cranial data allow us to reassess the interrelationships of Early Permian parareptiles\, which has critical implications for the diversity of parareptiles during the Early Permian. Parareptiles were a diverse clade of reptiles that were an important component of Middle and Late Permian ecosystems\, having gained a cosmopolitan distribution by the Middle Permian. In contrast to their diversity during the Middle and Late Permian\, parareptiles were historically considered to have a lower taxic diversity during the Early Permian\, as well as being rare members of Early Permian fossil assemblages. However\, with the numerous species that have been produced from the Richards Spur locality of Oklahoma in recent years\, we now have a much better view regarding the diversity of parareptiles during the Early Permian\, with their diversity coming close to matching that of Early Permian eureptiles. Richard Spur is also unique in that more than half of all known Early Permian parareptiles are found there\, as well as in capturing representatives of all major lineages of terrestrial parareptiles present during the Early Permian.",,"cbu:205,citekey: Macdougall2017,doi: 10.1093/zoolinnean/zlw012,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology","amniota,captorhinid reptile,clade,diversification,eureptilia,evolution,oklahoma,Palaeozoic,phylogeny,position,Reptilia,richards spur,texas","Macdougall\, Mark (author),Scott\, Diane (author),Modesto\, Sean (author),Williams\, Scott (author),Reisz\, Robert (author)",,2017,New material of the reptile Colobomycter pholeter (Parareptilia: Lanthanosuchoidea) and the diversity of reptiles during the Early Permian (Cisuralian),,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,777,ir:citationCModel

To meet the regulatory requirements\, the analytical procedures must provide adequate separation and identification of the 16 individual priority PAH. A 12 m conventional diameter NSP column provides fast separation of 16 priority PAH\, meeting the USEPA regulatory requirements specified in method 610. The new NSP columns are selective and highly stable with a maximum operating temperature limit of 370 degrees C. The columns have extremely low bleed at the standard working temperature of 325 degrees C normally used for PAH analyses. Due to low bleed\, these columns provide higher sensitivity for PAH in GC/FID and GC/MS analysis. Microbore columns with the NSP provide even faster analysis and ultra low bleed.

New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper\, middle\, and lower Florida Keys\, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs\, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi\, the latter also common in the natural reef areas\, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile\, suspension-feeding\, worm-snail\, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler\, Rawlings & Collins n. sp.

This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus\, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic\, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity\, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and\, as such\, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles\, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives\, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently\, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species.

There are various processes for the remediation of contaminated sites. The most commonly used methods include incineration\, solvent washing and/or extraction\, stabilization/solidification and base catalyzed soil remediation. A recent and more environmentally friendly method for remediation is the ""Sonoprocess (TM)."" The claim is that PCB are destroyed in a non-thermal way using a sodium reaction and high frequency vibration to remove the chlorine atoms from the biphenyl. In this study\, the process is modified to suit the Tar Ponds matrix and is tested on samples of PCB and PAH contaminated soil from the Tar Ponds. A steel bar (with a chamber containing the contaminated soil\, sodium\, and solvent attached to the end) is brought to its resonance frequency to destroy harmful contaminants.

Similar records are not known elsewhere among the former Gondwanan land masses\, but it was recently proposed on the basis of palaeontological evidence that the Buena Vista Formation of Uruguay preserves a South American record of continental PTB tetrapods. The Buena Vista Formation was previously correlated to the Lower Triassic (Olenekian) Sanga do Cabral Formation of Brazil on the basis of lithostratigraphic evidence\, but recent collecting in the former unit has produced a tetrapod fauna that is distinct to that documented for the latter. The unequivocal tetrapod fossils that have been described thus far from the Buena Vista Formation include indeterminate mastodonsaurid temnospondyls\, a plagiosauroid temnospondyl\, and a procolophonid reptile. The temnospondyls belong to Triassic groups\, whereas the procolophonid is allied most closely with Early Triassic taxa from the Karoo Basin.

A precise placement of the Buena Vista Formation in the Triassic on the basis of its tetrapod fauna is not possible at this time.

Recent studies have found increased selenium (Se) concentrations in scaup but have focused on the fall and spring staging periods. From January to March 2006 and December to March 2006 and 2007\, we analyzed liver tissues collected from greater scaup wintering in western Lake Ontario for 16 trace elements. We also measured Se concentrations in greater scaup blood and Dreissenid mussel tissue. Se was the only trace element that occurred at increased concentrations (> 10 mu g/g liver dry weight) in a substantial proportion (99%) of greater scaup livers. We also found that hepatic Se concentrations increased throughout winter and were increased in nearly all birds from January to March\, suggesting that accumulation of this trace element occurred soon after their arrival in fall. Se concentrations were similar in male and female birds\, but juvenile birds had higher concentrations than did adults. Blood Se concentrations were correlated to liver Se concentrations in 2006 only\, suggesting that blood Se concentration is an unreliable predictor of liver concentration. Se in Dreissenid mussels generally decreased with mussel size and did not change throughout winter. Overall\, our results suggest that greater scaup wintering on western Lake Ontario acquire sufficiently high Se concentrations to potentially impact their health. Thus\, several indicators of health and survival should be examined in relation to Se concentrations in wintering scaup.",,"cbu:519,citekey: Ware2011,doi: 10.1007/s00244-010-9625-z,cbu-school: Research Centers and Others,cbu-department: Verschuren Centre","body condition,aquatic birds,diagnostic-criteria,diving ducks,lesser scaup,mallards,quagga mussels,reproduction,toxicosis,zebra","Ware\, L (author),Petrie\, S (author),Badzinski\, S (author),Bailey\, R (author)",,2011,Selenium Concentrations in Greater Scaup and Dreissenid Mussels During Winter on Western Lake Ontario,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,819,ir:citationCModel

Partial reduction of the grazing frequency from four to two rotations and discontinuing the tending of sod and sward have been tested for extensive management of a mixed pasture at the Nova Scotia College of Agriculture in Truro since 2004. It is not well known how extensification affects the N cycle of organic pastures without mineral fertilizer or manure applications. Moisture and temperature of the topsoil and nitrate content of the leachate extracted with ceramic suction cups at 0.5 in depth were monitored prior to grazing and during sward regrowth in the first and second rotation in spring of 2005 and 2006. In each year\, more than 75% of all samples contained less than 2.5 mg NO3 center dot N L-1. A significant seasonal nitrate dynamic suggests that plant N uptake reduces nitrate leaching in the first rotation\, while soil biological activity increases N supply due to soil warming in excess of plant uptake\, thus raising the nitrate level in the second rotation.

However\, these field studies described only correlations between predator exposure and cell proliferation. Here\, we used a congener Brachyhypopomus gauderio and another electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus to experimentally test the hypothesis that exposure to a predator stimulus and tail injury causes alterations in brain cell proliferation. To simulate predator exposure\, we either amputated the tail followed by short-term (1 day) or longterm (17-18 days) recovery or repeatedly chased intact fish with a plastic rod over a 7 day period. We measured cell proliferation (PCNA + cell density) in the telencephalon and diencephalon\, and plasma cortisol\, which commonly mediates stress-induced changes in brain cell proliferation. In both species\, either tail amputation or simulated predator chase decreased cell proliferation in the telencephalon in a manner resembling the effect of predators in the field.

This study focuses on understanding the impact of net charge of whey peptides\, separated by electrodialysis with ultrafiltration membrane (EDUF)\, on encapsulation efficiency (EE) and surface properties of the peptide-loaded liposomes. EDUF resulted in two fractions; anionic whey peptides (AWP) with a relative abundance of 30.4% anionic amino acid residues\, and cationic whey peptides (CWP) with 20.39% cationic amino acid residues. Although free amino group of CWP was higher\, average peptide length and molecular weight were similar in both fractions. AWP liposomes had slightly lower encapsulation efficiency than encapsulated CWP. Encapsulated CWP had larger mean particle diameter and higher polydispersity index. However\, there was no apparent effect of peptide net charge on liposome surface charge (ζ-potential). FTIR spectra of the CWP- and AWP-loaded liposomes were similar and showed peptide interaction with the liposome phosphate groups. The peptide net charge did not appear to influence their distribution in different regions of the nanocapsules.

The water rock interaction phenomenon occurs due to carbonic acid generation which causes surface protonation reactions and has the potential to decrease water wettability of the system leading to enhanced water mobility and efficient gas injection. Therefore\, for a saline aquifer rock with minerals capable of ion exchange reactions that consume solution protons\, the wettability of such a system is likely to be preserved leading to reduced water mobility and poor gas injection.

Furthermore\, in the PC trimer an intense mode at 984 cm(-1) is assigned to the C-C stretching vibration while the mode at 454 cm(-1) is likely due to ethyl group torsion. In contrast\, in the similar chromophore phytochromobilin the C-5\,C-10\,C-15-D wag mode at 622 cm(-1) does not come from a down-shift of the HOOP. Additionally\, the absence of modes between 1200 and 1300 cm(-1) rules out functional monomerization. A correlation between phycocyanobilin (PCB) and phycoerythrobilin (PEB) suggests that the PCB cofactors of the PC trimer appear in a conformation similar to that of PEB. The conformation of the PC rod is consistent with that of the allophycocyanin (APC) trimer\, and thus excitonic flow is facilitated between these two independent light-harvesting compounds.

The burrow cast is similar to large burrow casts previously described from the LAZ that were identified as large-scale Scoyenia domichnia. It is the first large burrow cast from the LAZ found to contain diagnostic fossil bone. The burrow cast is a relatively straight\, subhorizontal (inclined dorsoventrally compressed tube consisting of an entry ramp and living chamber; the entrance to the burrow is not preserved and there is no evidence that the ramp formed a spiral section. The skeletal material comprises a single\, partial\, disarticulated skeleton of a juvenile animal that can be assigned with confidence to the dicynodont genus Lystrosaurus. Whereas similar large-diameter burrow casts from strata slightly higher in the LAZ have been attributed to Lystrosaurus\, we present an alternative hypothesis that a carnivorous tetrapod constructed the burrow.

Comparing to the traditional kinetic calibration method\, where the time constant was obtained from the extraction time profile\, the new calibration approach shows improved accuracy and precision. More importantly\, deuterated standards are not required in the new method\, thus significantly improving its cost-effectiveness and extending its applicability to a wide range of analytes lack of deuterated analogs serving as internal standards. In addition\, mass spectrometry is not necessary for the quantification of analytes with the new calibration method\, which may further extend the applicability of PE-HF-LPME to some laboratories without mass spectrometers. This study has been substantiated with both theoretical and experimental evidences. Further\, the feasibility of the method for real biological samples was demonstrated by measuring the free concentration of flunitrazepam in urine and plasma samples and its drug-protein binding ratio in plasma.

Using cyclic voltammetry\, open-circuit self-discharge measurements\, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) a positive 'correlation is established between self-discharge and the rate of carbon oxidation. During oxidation\, the Spectracarb 2225 carbon fabric is oxidized to CO2\, and develops C-O and C=O surface functionalities. The data show that C-O groups form initially\, predominately during electrode charging; the C=O groups form most significantly during the self-discharge. With repeated charge/self-discharge cycling\, a decrease in self discharge is observed\, likely due to the depletion of active sites for carbon oxidation. Hence\, eliminating these active surface sites\, either through electrochemical oxidation or chemical oxidation\, greatly reduces the self-discharge experienced by the positive carbon electrodes\, in aqueous electrochemical capacitors. The Spectracarb 2225 carbon exhibits ca. 50% less self-discharge when the carbon is fully oxidized (i.e.\, the surface sites are depleted) through electrochemical cycling versus the as-received carbon.

cbu:383,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Functional Ecology--0269-8463,"1. Environmental factors such as heat and solar radiation directly affect the open-cup nest environment and can impact nestling body temperature. 2. The aim of our research was to understand how open-cup passerine nestlings use behavioural thermoregulation to mitigate solar heat gain and to measure the metabolic cost of begging and non-begging activity under three light treatments: room light (<2 Wm(-2))\, simulated shade (500 Wm(-2)) and simulated sun (1000 Wm(-2)). Our study coupled behavioural (field) and physiological (laboratory) experiments to explore the adaptive behavioural response of passerine nestlings to nest cup nanoclimates (sun and shade)\, using the common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) as a model species. 3. Non-begging behaviour was evaluated in the field by randomly assigning nestlings to a homogeneous (all sun) or heterogeneous (sun and shade) nest environment; measuring body temperature (Tb); and identifying behaviours from videotaped footage. The Tb of nestlings without access to shade was significantly higher\, and nestlings spent more time moving and panting\, suggesting an increased metabolic expenditure. To test this\, we duplicated the insolation nanoclimate under laboratory conditions using a 1.0 KW Sciencetech Illumination System and measured the energetic cost of begging and non-begging activity using open-system respirometry on non-irradiated and irradiated nestlings.

State openness scores were based on state-aggregated survey responses of over 600\,000 residents to a common Big Five personality questionnaire. For 46 states (excluding Alaska\, Hawaii\, Nevada\, and Idaho because of lack of suitable data)\, patents per state population was negatively related to conservatism (r=-.65) and positively related to openness (r=.50). These associations persisted when state socioeconomic status (SES)\, estimates of IQ\, and degree of urbanization were statistically considered. Multiple regression analysis showed that conservatism and openness together accounted for 46.5% of the criterion variance without controls and 22.7% with SES controlled.

From self-determination we move on to discuss self-confidence and language anxiety\, highlighting their academic and social effects. The language learning context exerts significant influences on the learning process and its outcomes via the operation of the pedagogical and social psychological milieu. A key social psychological outcome of language learning is change in identity\, a concern that plays out differently in minority and majority groups.

The literature values of the integrated intensities of the infrared active fundamentals of the three gaseous isotopomers are used to determine the dipole moment derivatives with respect to internal coordinates\, using the methods described in the previous paper for the liquid phase. As was found for the liquid phase in the previous paper\, there is uncertainty surrounding the intensities of the individual CH stretching fundamentals of benzene-d(1) due to intensity sharing with active combinations. The magnitudes of the dipole moment derivatives with respect to internal coordinates in the gas phase are partial derivative mu/partial derivative s=0.50 +/- 0.03 D angstrom(-1)\, partial derivative mu/partial derivative beta=0.28 +/- 0.03\, partial derivative mu/partial derivative beta=0.24 +/- 0.01\, and partial derivative mu/partial derivative gamma=0.65 +/- 0.02 D angstrom(-1)\, where s\, t\, beta and gamma are the CH stretching\, and CC stretching\, the HCC bending and the HCCC torsion displacements\, respectively.

The pace of application has been held back\, however\, by the reluctance of industry to make the accommodations necessary to allow wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops\, thus limiting the potential applications and benefits of wireless systems. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining the performance of control loops\, which can be degraded by slow data rates and delays in wireless paths\, and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network\, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will\, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in the network nodes\, which are very often battery powered. We address this conflict by developing a new! component for use in industrial control systems\, called a Wireless Networked Control System Coordination Agent.

The new specimen comprises a skull and articulated anterior portion of the postcranial skeleton. Olivierosuchus parringtoni can be distinguished from its akidnognathid relatives\, Promoschorhynchus and Moschorhinus\, by the presence of a relatively slender snout. Features that further distinguish Olivierosuchus from Promoschorhynchus include fewer upper postcanines\, an obtuse angle of the transverse process of the pterygoid and an oblique alignment of the suborbital fenestra margin of the palatine. Features that further distinguish Olivierosuchus from Moschorhinus include the presence of a sharp rather than blunt crista choanalis\, a spatulate posterior portion of the ectopterygoid instead of a narrow shaft\, the presence of prominent pterygoid tuberosities and a narrow\, elongated tabular. A reappraisal of Lower Triassic therocephalian biostratigraphy reveals that most of these taxa are restricted to the lowermost part of the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone revealing a high diversity\, whereafter the diversity decreases dramatically in the middle of the zone. However\, despite their scarcity in the middle and upper Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone\, therocephalians in the Karoo Basin remain the most diverse therapsid clade in the lowermost Triassic\, which suggests that they were able to recover relatively quickly from the end-Permian extinction event and form an important part of the postextinction earliest Triassic recovery.",,"cbu:523,citekey: Botha-Brink2011,doi: 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2011.01048.x,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology","evolution,South Africa,Early Triassic,boundary,cladistic relationships,extinction,Karoo   Basin,Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone,primitive cynodont procynosuchus,therapsids,therocephalians","Botha-Brink\, Jennifer (author),Modesto\, Sean (author)",,2011,A new skeleton of the therocephalian synapsid Olivierosuchus parringtoni from the Lower Triassic South African Karoo Basin,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,896,ir:citationCModel

The first Richards Spur parareptile to be described was Colobomycter pholeter. It has been characterized by its enlarged premaxillary tooth and paired enlarged maxillary teeth\, unique dentition that grants it an appearance quite distinct from other parareptiles at Richards Spur. Here we describe new cranial material from Richards Spur that is referable to Colobomycter. This new material differs from that of C. pholeter in that it possesses at least three more teeth on its maxilla\, the enlarged premaxillary and maxillary teeth are more gracile than those in C. pholeter\, and the lacrimal is restricted externally to the orbital margin and does not exhibit an extra lateral exposure. We infer that these differences merit specific distinction and assign the new fossil to Colobomycter vaughni\, sp. nov. The discovery of C. vaughni at Richards Spur is important\, because it reveals the presence of another member of the clade Lanthanosuchoidea in Oklahoma\, making it the sixth to be found in the state.

The pace of application in the context of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) has been somewhat impeded\, however\, by the reluctance of industry to accept the risks of allowing wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining control loop performance\, which can be degraded by many factors\, such as low data rates\, delays in wireless paths\, jitter and electromagnetic interference; and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network\, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will\, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in battery-powered network nodes. In the context of developing advanced controls technology for systems with wireless networks in feedback paths there is a strong need for a test environment that can be used to explore all facets of such systems\, including potential problems relating to control loop performance and WSN management. We propose to address this requirement by developing a new testbed for research in WNCSs by adding advanced control agents and process simulators from the Intelligent Control and Asset Management or ICAM project to an existing WSN testbed called the Wireless Industrial Sensor Network Testbed for Radio-Harsh Environments or WINTeR. This testbed has been custom developed for oil and gas industrial environments\, i.e.\, it includes features such as electromagnetic interference and complex multipath propagation. The proposed new testbed\, hereafter called WINTeR-ICAM\, will include the ICAM Supervisor\, ICAM Agents and an additional agent to resolve conflicts between maintaining control loop performance and managing the WSN effectively and efficiently\, called a WNCS Coordination Agent or WNCSCA. This agent is designed to be part of an intelligent supervisory control system\, and to grant the WSN as much latitude in meeting its objectives as possible while maintaining the performance of control loops that incorporate wireless paths\, thus adding to the safety and reliability of future WNCSs. Together\, the process simulators\, ICAM Agents and WINTeR will provide a powerful new environment for research and development of advanced WNCS technology\, with WSN hardware and software in the loop; this novel conception is the contribution of this paper.",,"cbu:590,citekey: Taylor2010,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Engineering",,"Taylor\, James (author),Slipp\, Jeff (author)",,2010,An Integrated Testbed for Advanced Wireless Networked Control Systems Technology,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,898,ir:citationCModel

In this paper\, a brief history of ANN and the basic concepts behind the computing\, the mathematical and algorithmic formulation of each of the techniques\, and their developmental background is presented. Based on the abilities of ANNs in pattern recognition and estimation of system outputs from the known inputs\, the neural network can be considered as a tool for molecular data analysis and interpretation. Analysis by neural networks improves the classification accuracy\, data quantification and reduces the number of analogues necessary for correct classification of biologically active compounds. Conformational analysis and quantifying the components in mixtures using NMR spectra\, aqueous solubility prediction and structure-activity correlation are among the reported applications of ANN as a new modeling method. Ranging from drug design and discovery to structure and dosage form design\, the potential pharmaceutical applications of the ANN methodology are significant.

Recently\, the pivotal role of insectivory in tetrapod evolution was emphasized by the identification of putative insectivores as the closest relatives of the oldest known herbivorous amniotes. We provide the first compelling evidence for insectivory among early tetrapods on the basis of two 280-million-year-old (late Palaeozoic) fossil specimens of a new species of acleistorhinid parareptile with preserved arthropod cuticle on their toothed palates. Their dental morphology\, consisting of homodont marginal dentition with cutting edges and slightly recurved tips\, is consistent with an insectivorous diet. The intimate association of arthropod cuticle with the oral region of two small reptiles\, from a rich fossil locality that has otherwise not produced invertebrate remains\, strongly supports the inference of insectivory in the reptiles.

So far\, the SCS has yielded temnospondyls\, parareptiles\, archosauromorphs\, putative synapsids\, and a number of indeterminate specimens. In the absence of absolute dates for these rocks\, a biostratigraphic approach is necessary to establish the ages of the SCF and the BVF. It is well established that the SCF is Early Triassic mainly due to the presence of the widespread Gondwanan reptile Procolophon trigoniceps. Conversely\, the age of the BVF is subject of great controversy\, being regarded alternatively as Permian\, Permo-Triassic\, and Early Triassic. The BVF has yielded the definite procolophonid Pintosqurus magnidentis. Procolophonoidea is one of the most diverse and conspicuous terrestrial tetrapod groups of the Lower Triassic Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone in the Karoo Basin of South Africa\, which preserves tetrapods from the aftermath of the end-Permian extinction event Based on a previous interpretation that the fauna of the BVF is Permian\, and in the reinterpretation of disarticulated vertebrae from SCF with 'swollen' neural arches as belonging to either seymouriamorphs or diadectomorphs\, it was recently suggested that at least part of the SCF is Permian in age\, which prompted this comprehensive reevaluation of both SCS's faunal content and geology. Moreoever\, new\, strikingly large procolophonid specimens (skull\, vertebra\, and a mandibular fragment) from the SCF are described and referred to the genus Procolophon. The large procolophonid vertebra described here contradicts the recent hypothesis that similar specimens from the SCF belong to seymouriamorphs or diadectomorphs\, because its morphology is consistent with that found in Procolophon. There is not a single diagnostic specimen that supports the inference of Permian levels in the SCS. Accordingly\, because all diagnostic and biostratigraphically informative fossils from the SCF and the BVF are either Early Triassic or restricted to the Triassic\, we conclude that the available biostratigraphic data reinforce an Early Triassic age assignment to the SCS.

The technology acceptance model (TAM) with its constituent variables such as perceived usefulness (PUSS) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) was the theoretical framework used for this study. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Nova Scotia\, Canada. Usable data was collected from 197 registered nurses (RNs). Relevant hypotheses were formulated and the partial least squares (PLS) technique was used for data analysis. Results: The results of the hypothesized relationships showed that education and computer knowledge have positive moderating effects on the influences of PEOU and PUSS on nurses' attitudes toward IS (ATTI). The factors of nurses' years of nursing experience and age did not yield meaningful results. ATTI impacted behavioral intentions to use IS\, which positively impacted nurses' use of IS. The nurses sampled in the study have positive IS use behaviors. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that relevant demographic factors and individual characteristics\, if incorporated into frameworks used for investigating nurses' acceptance of IS\, could permit the emergence of useful insights for practitioners and researchers. Specifically\, this study showed that nurses with higher educational attainments and more basic computer knowledge readily accept implemented IS at work.

The anchoring-adjustment hypothesis suggests that the stereotype of stuttering arises from a process of first anchoring the stereotype in personal feelings during times of normal speech disfluency\, and then adjusting based on a rapid heuristic judgment. The current research sought to test this hypothesis\, elaborating on previous research by [White\, P. A.\, & Collins\, S. R. (1984). Stereotype formation by inference: A possible explanation for the ""stutterer"" stereotype. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research\, 27\, 567-570]. Participants provided ratings of a hypothetical typical person who stutters\, a person suffering from normal speech disfluency and a typical male on a 25-item semantic differential scale. Results showed a stereotype of people who stutter similar to that found in previous research. The pattern of results is consistent with the anchoring-adjustment hypothesis. Ratings of a male stutterer are very similar to a male experiencing temporary disfluency\, both of which differ from ratings of a typical male. As expected\, ratings of a stutterer show a small but statistically significant adjustment on several traits that makes the stereotype of stutterers less negative and less emotionally extreme than the temporarily disfluent male. Based on the results of this research\, it appears that stereotype formation is a result of generalization and adjustment from personal experience during normal speech distluency. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (1) explain how the negative stereotype of people who stutter arises; (2) discuss the negative implications of stereotypes in the lives of people who stutter; and (3) summarize why the stereotype of people who stutter is so consistent and resistant to change.

The rate at which these organisms redistribute sedimentary particles is the focus of this research in which a new method is presented to address specific disadvantages of previous studies documenting tubificid bioadvection. The new approach incorporates an aquarium inoculated with sediment and worms in which the sediment surface is photographed through time as tubificids produce fecal mounds. Employing computer software\, mounds are traced\, and using a known pixel length\, the program calculates the traced area\, which is converted to volume of upturned sediment by assuming an idealized conical shape. This method resulted in a particle redistribution rate for a population of Limnodrilus and Tubifex at 0.042-0.139 cm/d/100\,000 individuals/m(2) at 21 degrees C. During sediment reworking\, segregation of silt and clay forms biogenic graded bedding defined by a poorly sorted bed with an overall decrease in mean\, modal\, and median grain sizes upward. This tubificid-formed graded bedding could be recognized in the rock record through careful analyses of grain-size distributions that distinguish biogenic reworking from physically graded beds. Ichnologically\, this occurrence corresponds to the broad conditions defined by the Mermia Ichnofacies\, but is yet unrecognized and may actually obliterate typical traces associated with this ichnofacies.

P-O-P asymmetric stretchings in both FT-IR (987.2 cm(-1)\, 874.1 cm(-1) and 792 cm(-1)) and FT-Raman (986.3 cm(-1)\, 1057.6 cm(-1) and 875.2 cm(-1)) were found as characteristics of brushite crystals. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed brushite crystallization purity using gel method by studying their endothermic peaks. This study incorporated a multidisciplinary approach in characterizing CHPD crystals grown in vitro to help formulate prevention or dissolution strategy in controlling urinary stone growth. Initial studies with 0.2 M citric acid ions as controlling agent in the nucleation of brushite crystals further support the presented approach. (c) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Fabrication of SNAs having high hybridization capacity to their complementary sequences is critical to ensure their applicability in areas such as antisense gene therapy and cellular sensing. The traditional salt-aging procedure is effective but tedious\, requiring 1-3 days to complete. The rapid low-pH assisted protocol is efficient\, but causes concerns related to nonspecific DNA adsorption to the AuNP core. To address these issues\, we systematically compared the SNAs prepared by these two methods (salt-aging method and low-pH protocol). In terms of the number of complementary DNA that each SNA can bind and the average binding affinity of each thiolated DNA probe to its complementary strand\, both methods yielded comparable hybridizability\, although higher loading capacity was witnessed with SNAs made using the low-pH method. Additionally\, it was found that nonspecific DNA binding could be eliminated almost completely by a simple glutathione (GSH) treatment of SNAs. Compared to conventional methods using toxic mercapto-hexanol or alkanethiols to remove nonspecific DNA adsorption\, GSH is mild\, cost-effective\, and technically easy to use. In addition\, GSH-passivated SNAs minimize the toxicity concerns related to AuNP-induced GSH depletion and therefore offer a more biocompatible alternative to previously reported SNAs. Moreover\, rational design of probe sequences through inclusion of a polythymine spacer into the DNA sequences resulted in enhanced DNA loading capacity and stability against salt-induced aggregation.

cbu:305,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,International Journal of Psychophysiology--0167-8760,"Frustration is a normative affective response with an adaptive value in motivating behavior. However\, excessive anger in response to frustration characterizes multiple forms of externalizing psychopathology. How a given trait subserves both normative and pathological behavioral profiles is not entirely clear. One hypothesis is that the magnitude of response to frustration differentiates normative versus maladaptive reactivity. Disproportionate increases in arousal in response to frustration may exceed normal regulatory capacity\, thus precipitating aggressive or antisocial responses. Alternatively\, pathology may arise when reactivity to frustration interferes with other cognitive systems\, impairing the individual's ability to respond to frustration adaptively. In this paper we examine these two hypotheses in a sample of kindergarten children. First we examine whether children with conduct problems (CP; n = 105) are differentiated from comparison children (n = 135) with regard to magnitude of autonomic reactivity (cardiac and electrodermal) across a task that includes a frustrative non-reward block flanked by two reward blocks. Second we examine whether cognitive processing\, as reflected by magnitude of the P3b brain response\, is disrupted in the context of frustrative non-reward. Results indicate no differences in skin conductance\, but a greater increase in heart rate during the frustration block among children in the CP group. Additionally\, the CP group was characterized by a pronounced decrement in P3b amplitude during the frustration condition compared with both reward conditions. No interaction between cardiac and P3b measures was observed\, suggesting that each system independently reflects a greater sensitivity to frustration in association with externalizing symptom severity.

These crises are compromising the diet and health of up to 80% of the population in most developing countries and threaten the development of almost an entire generation of children (similar to 250 million)\, because the period from conception until 24 mo of age irreversibly shapes people's health and intellectual ability. High food prices reduce diversity and nutritional quality of the diet and for many also reduce food quantity. Poor households are hit hardest\, because they already spend 50-80% of expenditures on food\, little on medicines\, education\, transport\, or cooking fuel\, and cannot afford to pay more. Reduced public spending\, declining incomes\, increased food and fuel prices\, and reduced remittance thus impede and reverse progress made toward Millenium Development Goals 1\, 4\, and 5.

Single-layer covers utilize the moisture “store-and-release” concept to first store and then release moisture back to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Although more commonly used in semi-arid and arid climates\, store-and-release covers remain an attractive option in humid climates due to the low cost and relative simplicity of installation. However\, knowledge of their performance in these climates is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of moisture store-and-release covers at full-scale WRPs located in humid climates. This cover type was installed at a WRP in Nova Scotia\, Canada\, alongside state-of-the-art monitoring instrumentation. Field monitoring was conducted over 5 years to assess key components such as meteorological conditions\, cover material water dynamics\, net percolation\, surface runoff\, pore-gas\, environmental receptor water quality\, landform stability and vegetation. Water balances indicate small reductions in water influx to the waste rock (i.e.\, 34 to 28% of precipitation) with the diminished AMD release also apparent by small improvements in groundwater quality (increase in pH\, decrease in sulfate/metals). Surface water quality analysis and field observations of vegetative/aquatic life demonstrate significant improvements in the surface water receptor. The WRP landform is stable and the vegetative cover is thriving. This study has shown that while a simple store-and-release cover may not be a highly effective barrier to water infiltration in humid climates\, it can be used to (i) eliminate contaminated surface water runoff\, (ii) minimize AMD impacts to surface water receptor(s)\, (iii) maintain a stable landform\, and (iv) provide a sustainable vegetative canopy.",,"cbu:1424,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Chemistry,doi: 10.1007/s10661-018-6555-0,pmid: 29502321",acid mine drainage--contaminant remediation--hydrogeochemistry--environmental monitoring--water balance--landform stability,"Power\, Christopher (author),Ramasamy\, Murugan (author),Mkandawire\, Martin (author)",,,"Performance assessment of a single-layer moisture store-and-release cover system at a mine waste rock pile in a seasonally humid region (Nova Scotia\, Canada)",,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,992,ir:citationCModel

During the course of this research\, data was collected from the online formative assessments of the last module of the chemistry course and students were invited to complete a survey that contained approximately 30 Likert-type statements which were delivered using Google Forms. All of the formative assessments’ data was analyzed and correlations with the perceptions survey and summative assessments were calculated to find tendencies and analyze the results. It was hypothesized that data would emerge and suggest better ways of using and implementing Google Forms as a formative assessment tool and hopefully determine if students found the use of Google Forms as an assessment to be beneficial.The results have confirmed that students do feel that online formative assessments have improved their grade\, that they are easy to complete and are not perceived as extra work or a burden.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies show DIBI is effective against representative reference strains for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria S. aureus and A. baumannii\, and the fungus C. albicans. Compared to the small molecule iron chelators\, deferiprone and deferoxamine\, DIBI outclassed these by factors of 100 to 1000 for inhibition of initial growth.

Full incorporation of the HPO monomer into the co-polymers from the reaction solution was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ranged from 4.6 to 25.6 mol%.

The depletion of conventional crude oil reserves is accompanied by growing economic demand for various types of fuel\, biodiesels and petrochemical products creating the need for remediation of heavier asphaltenic crude [1]. Thus\, the extraction\, transportation and refining of this highly viscous\, high paraffinic\, high sulfur content crude oil and its wastes is becoming more prominent since heavy oil deposits exceed light oil deposits by two orders of magnitude [2]. In this work\, multiple crude oils were studied for hydro-desulphurization (HDS) and defragmentation processes by a novel method of microwave irradiation. The specific objectives were to identify conditions that would upgrade the oil\nand simultaneously substantially reduced the sulphur content using microwave irradiation\, and to obtain preliminary data on process economics. Results showed strong indications for the microwave technology to be employed not only for hydrocarbon extractions but also for in-situ and field upgrading of heavy oil\, and reduction in sulphur content of crude oil. There was evidence of fragmentation and combination reactions present in the process\, as well as high percentreduction in sulphur content. Overall\, the microwave technologypresents the best alternative\, economically and environmentally\, to\nthe existing technologies for enhanced oil recovery operations and processing. The microwave process employs specific frequency microwaves targeted into the formation containing heavy hydrocarbons to initiate conversion of the hydrocarbon into synthetic crude\, with reduced discharge of greenhouse gas into the environment as natural gasor other fuels are not required to reduce viscosity [3]. The specific objectives were to identify conditions that would upgrade the oil and achieve up to 50% desulphurization using microwave irradiation\, and to obtain preliminary data on process design and economics.\nTypical reactions in the removal of various organic sulphur compounds have been identified as follows:\nThiols\nR—SH + H2 → RH + H2\nS\nNaphthenes-\, Aromatic-\, and Alkyl- Suphides\nR—S—R’ + 2H2\n → RH + R’H + H2\nS\nDisulphides\nR—SS—R’ + 3H2\n → RH + R’H + 2H2\nS\nThe process of the study was based upon expansion of Miadonyeet al.’s 2009 article focusing upon crude oil desulphurization\, howeverin the case of this project\, acquiring a further array of oil compositions and loosely defining the limits of microwave exposure.",,"cbu:1485,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Chemistry,http://hendun.org/journals/EEO/EEO-103.php",microwave irradiation--oil upgrading--heavy crude oil--bitumen viscosity,"MacDonald\, Brittany (author),Miadonye\, Adango (author)",,,Microwave application in petroleum processing,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:1485/datastream/PDF/download,1003,ir:citationCModel

Earth Sci.--2296-6463,"The early amniote clade Mesosauridae has long been of interest to scientists\, primarily due to the members of the clade being the oldest secondarily aquatic tetrapods and their role as a line of evidence for continental drift. In the landmark phylogenetic analysis of Parareptilia by Gauthier and colleagues in 1988\, Mesosauridae was found to be the sister taxon of all included parareptiles. Over the last three decades several studies regarding the phylogenetic placement of mesosaurs have helped to reinforce their position as the most basal parareptile clade. The most recent study of Mesosauridae is by Laurin and Piñeiro\, who reassess the phylogenetic position of the clade within early amniotes. This new analysis recovered mesosaurs as being the sister clade to all other sauropsids\, supporting the results of an earlier study by Laurin and Reisz in 1995. However\, we feel that there are two main issues with this new study that need to be addressed.

Cover systems containing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liners have the attributes to be highly effective; however\, their performance over the long-term is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of an ‘in-service’ HDPE-lined cover system for reducing AMD contamination at WRP sites. A numerical investigation of a former mining site containing a large WRP reclaimed with an HDPE cover is presented. A 3-D groundwater flow and contaminant transport model of the site was developed in FEFLOW to predict the spatial and temporal evolution of AMD over 100 years. Field parameters observed at 46 monitoring wells over a 5-year monitoring period (including hydraulic head\, recharge\, hydraulic conductivity and water quality) were used as key input and calibration parameters. The HDPE cover significantly reduced both water recharge to the waste rock (i.e.\, 512 to 50 mm/year) and AMD seepage to groundwater. Both the groundwater flow and contaminant transport (sulfate was used as an AMD tracer) components of the model were calibrated and verified to the observed field data\, with strong correlations evident between observed and simulated hydraulic heads and sulfate concentrations\, respectively. Long-term model predictions of AMD evolution indicated significant and continual reductions in sulfate concentrations over time at all well locations. Background concentration levels (25 mg/L) are expected to be reached within 40 years.

Patients with low-to-medium shyness showed reductions in P100 amplitude to emotional compared to neutral faces as shyness increased. Patients reporting medium-to-high shyness demonstrated the opposite pattern; P100 amplitude sharply increased as shyness increased\, possibly reflecting heightened vigilance.

Thus\, WRPs can be a long-term source of environmental pollution. Since the generation of AMD and its release into the environment is dependent on the net volume and bulk composition of waste rock\, effective characterization of WRPs is necessary for successful remedial design and monitoring. In this study\, a combined DC resistivity and induced polarization (DC-IP) approach was employed to characterize an AMD-generating WRP in the Sydney Coalfield\, Nova Scotia\, Canada. Two-dimensional (2D) DC-IP imaging with 6 survey lines was performed to capture the full WRP landform. 2D DC results indicated a highly heterogeneous and moderately conductive waste rock underlain by a resistive bedrock containing numerous fractures. 2D chargeability results identified several highly-chargeable regions within the waste\, with normalized chargeability delineating regions specific to waste mineralogy only. Three-dimensional (3D) DC-IP imaging\, using 17 parallel lines on the pile plateau\, was then used to focus on the composition of the waste rock. The full 3D inverted DC-IP distributions were used to identify coincident and continuous zones (isosurfaces) of low resistivity (<30 Ω-m) and high normalized chargeability (>0.4 mS/m) that were inferred as generated AMD (leachate) and stored AMD (sulfides)\, respectively.

Important and not incidental\, this crisis results from gendered\, colonial\, and neoliberal policies and practices sedimented over time. One‐person households which are low‐income and non‐senior (LINS) have fallen through a crack created by a gendered and colonial welfare state that has primarily focused on “deserving” families; a neoliberal political economy has widened this chasm by making housing less affordable and workers more vulnerable\, while diminishing social supports. We illustrate our argument through a case study of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality\, a region in Nova Scotia with a struggling economy. Using data from sources including housing providers\, tenants\, and the local homelessness count\, we demonstrate the significant unemployment and low median incomes for one‐person LINS households\, and describe how this household type\, more than any other\, experiences core housing need and homelessness.

Behaviourally\, hatchery-spawned kelts exited freshwater prematurely (~66 days earlier on average) compared to wild-spawned counterparts\, which was associated with a marked increase in estuarine mortality. Furthermore\, survival to repeat-spawning was 0% (0/30) for hatchery-spawned kelts and 6.5% (2/31) for wild-spawned.

Louisbourg Seafoods Ltd. is currently investing in efforts to identify an environmentally beneficial disposal method for the considerable amount waste generated by processing of snow crab. For every crab processed one third of each crab body will end up in Canadian landfills. A proposed method for this waste stream is to generate biochar. Crab based biochar was generated by slow pyrolysis at 400°C for 4 hours. The generated biochar was fully characterized by FT-IR\, BET\, XRD\, TEM\, and GC-MS. The crab biochar was found to have a surface area of 16.3 m2/g by BET analysis. FT-IR and XRD showed there was a significant amount of calcium carbonate in the crab biochar. XRD showed the crystal structure is calcite. A Palladium-Zinc-CaCO3 catalyst was generated to catalyze the hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes. This catalyst is hypothesized to be stereospecific for the cis-alkene product. The performance of the catalyst was analyzed by a simple hydrogenation of 2-butyne-1\,4-diol. The Pd-Zn-CaCO3 catalyst was active\, however the product produced was butane-1\,4-diol instead of cis-2-butene-1\,4-diol.

The study of AI and Masters athletes (MAs) has received less attention. The relationship between AI and motivation was tested with a large sample of MAs (n = 455; Mage = 51.97\, SD = 11.51). MAs completed the Athletic Identity Questionnaire (AIQ) and Behavioral Regulation in Sport Questionnaire (BRSQ). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the four-factor (i.e.\, appearance\, importance\, competence\, encouragement) structure of the AIQ (X2(183) = 384.02\, p < .005\, CFI = .944\, RMSEA = .049) and the six-factor (i.e.\, intrinsic\, integrated\, identified\, introjected\, external and amotivation) structure of the BRSQ (X2(237) = 646.26\, p < .005\, CFI = .872\, RMSEA = .062). The structural model (X2(900) = 1682.28\, p < .005\, CFI = .901\, RMSEA = .044) showed significant relationships between the importance of sport and MAs' intrinsic (B = .167)\, integrated (B = .227)\, identified (B = .249)\, and external (B = -.239) motives.

Gracilaria caudata is commercially exploited as a raw material for agar production in Brazil\, and Laurencia catarinensis is a source of halogenated terpenoids with several biological activities. Investigations to understand the development of seaweeds of biotechnological interest are required in order to improve their cultivation and the sustainability for biomass production on an industrial scale. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Ascophyllum/Acadian marine plant extract powder (AMPEP)\, a commercial\, water-soluble extract of the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum\, on the growth\, branching development\, and pigment content of G. caudata and L. catarinensis. Four concentrations of AMPEP (0\, 0.1\, 1.0\, and 5.0 mg L−1) were added to sterilized seawater (seawater+AMPEP)\, and to a medium comprised of half-strength von Stosch solution (VSES/2+AMPEP). Experiments were performed under conditions of 23 ± 2 °C\, a light:dark cycle of 14:10 h\, salinity at 32 psu\, and photon flux densities of 60 ± 10 μmol photons m−2 s−1. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA\, followed by a posteriori multiple comparison\, Student-Newman-Keuls’ test. Treatments of seawater+AMPEP at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg L−1 stimulated the growth rates of G. caudata when compared to the control. However\, the effects of seawater+AMPEP and VSES/2+AMPEP on the branching architecture of the thalli were not significant for either species. Concentrations of phycoerythrin\, phycocyanin\, allophycocyanin\, and chlorophyll-a in L. catarinensis were stimulated by the highest concentration of VSES/2+AMPEP (i.e.\, 5.0 mg L−1). This is the first study to report the stimulatory effect of AMPEP on the phycobiliprotein contents of selected red algae. Furthermore\, seawater+AMPEP in concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg L−1 stimulated growth rates of G. caudata\, which could be applied in its large-scale cultivation.

cbu:1213,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Canadian Journal of Communication--0705-3657,"In one of the artides marking Mohamud's return to Canada\, [Haroon Siddiqui] asked the following questions on August 16 about the Conservative government in relation to the case: ""Is it racist? Anti-Muslim? Too ideological? Prone to micromanagement? Or just plain incompdent?"" (2009b\, p. A15). A reader responded to Siddiqui in the August 17 issue noting that cases similar to Mohamud's had occurred under the watch of previous Liberal actaiinistrations and thus: ""regardless of who is in power\, the problem is systemic As a previous letter writer pointed out\, all of these cases involve Muslims"" ([Behrens\, Matthew]\, 2009\, p. Aio). In another artide\, on August 20\, Siddiqui continued with his exploration of the racial theme\, quoting a Canadian-Somali broadcaster as saying that "" fmjany Canadian embassies have an assumption of who's a Canadian The colour of your skin still plays a role\, even when you have a Canadian passport I was happy when [Brenda Martin] was brought back from Mexico in a government jet But we should help not just those who might look like the government's idea of a Canadian but\, rather\, all Canadians' "" (Siddiqui\, 2009e P- A27). The paper's editorial that day also called for legislation compelling the government to ad on behalf of dtizens abroad\, since recent systemic failures ""can leave new Canadians such as Mohamud feeling the sting of official indifference Since 9/11\, Muslims especially have suffered"" (Editorial\, 2009\, August 20\, p. A26). This theme was present in an artide by the Star's Oakland Ross in the August 22 issue of the paper (2009b). Also in that issue was a report that Mohamud had launched a lawsuit against the Canadian government over her treatment ([John Goddard]\, 2009g). The story indicated that Mohamud suspeded race to be a factor in her plight However\, an August 29 artide by the paper's Thomas Walkom suggested that it was not just a matter of radsm but also a matter of the Conservative government's ideological posture toward Muslims vis-à-vis a commitment to the war on terror (Walkom\, 2009). Walkom argued that there is mainstream rejection of Muslim immigration to Canada\, and the government's attitude to various cases of Muslim Canadians played to a mainstream constituency.\n\nThe National Post commenced covering the Mohamud case on July 23\, when the federal government finally mandated the DNA tests that subsequently vindicated Mohamud's identity daims (Huber\, 2009a). From the initial report\, the National Post articulated the story as one of triumph for Mohamud\, who would finally get the opportunity to return home. Unlike the Toronto Star\, the Post did not give the story consistent coverage after the first report and resumed coverage in mid-August. In an August 12 report\, the paper quoted Mohamud's lawyer as saying "" 'there definitely needs to be a review of what went wrong. . . . What is the methodology for determining that they (Canadian passport-holders) really are a Canadian dtizen? We can't just go by intuition or profiling or value judgments' "" (Huber\, 2009b\, p. A5). However\, the lawyer's comments did not have much visibility in the narrative. They appeared at the end of a detailed report about Mohamud's travails and the steps being finally taken by the Canadian government to enable her return. Although the story was sympathetic to Mohamud's plight\, the allegation of racism would have had more visibility had it been treated as a story in its own right (as The Globe and Mail had done) or at least appeared as part of the headline. Also\, when the National Post subsequently commented on the case in an editorial on August 13 titled ""Mohamud's Nightmare"" (2009\, p. A12)\, questioning the government's daim to have conduded ""condusive investigations"" in the case\, it did not mention the racial element\, focusing only on bureaucratic failures. A letter to the editor on August 19 complained that Mohamud's case\, in the context of the government's reaction to the cases of other Muslim Canadians abroad (and in contrast to the government's reaction to the Brenda Martin case)\, refleded a discriminatory attitude (Jabbar\, 2009).

The interview phase revealed that African Nova Scotian undergraduates experienced lower library anxiety than Caucasian Nova Scotians. Specifically\, African Nova Scotians expressed comfort interacting with their community and public libraries prior to attending university. While attending university\, their initial reaction was overwhelmingly positive\, reflecting their previous experiences with community libraries. However\, throughout their degree programs their library anxiety increased when faced with barriers\, particularly with staff. In contrast\, the interviews revealed that Caucasian Nova Scotian undergraduates experienced higher levels of discomfort and anxiety during their pre-university interactions with public libraries and throughout their university programs. Based on the findings\, this study contributes to a racial and Canadian context rarely discussed in Library and Information Science.

These major light variations were superimposed on a chaotic\, flaring-type activity caused by hotspots resulting from unstable accretion – a situation reminiscent of that in 2011\, when TW Hya showed signs of a moderately stable accretion state. In 2015\, only drifting quasi-periods were observed\, similar to those present in 2008–2009 data and typical for magnetized stars accreting in a strongly unstable regime. A rich set of multicolour data was obtained during 2013–2017 with the primary aim of characterizing the basic spectral properties of the mysterious occultations in TW Hya. Although several possible occultation-like events were identified\, they are not as well defined as in the 2011 MOST data.

This was undertaken in order to develop management tools and best practice recommendations for the mass production of new plantlets (seedlings) for industrial\, nursery\, and out-planting purposes in eastern Malaysia\, Sabah\, and Peninsular Malaysia (i.e.\, Langkawi\, Kedah and Batu Maung\, Penang). After 45 days of laboratory incubation\, the three strains tested demonstrated their best performances at 3 mg L−1 of AMPEP\, supplemented with PGR. This evaluation was based on the longest direct axes formed\, the shortest time to their appearance\, and also their highest percentage emergence.

Among them are a deeper understanding of rights and social responsibility\, an improved school climate\, and greater school engagement and achievement. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess whether children's rights education has the power to improve educational outcomes for socially disadvantaged children in particular. Sample: A sample of three primary schools was included in the study. These were drawn from a wider sample of English schools participating in the Hampshire Education Local Authority's Rights\, Respect and Responsibility initiative (RRR). Design and methods: Building on a longitudinal study\, we compared Year 6 children in three schools that varied in the degree to which they had implemented RRR: one in a disadvantaged area that has fully implemented RRR (School 1); one in a disadvantaged area that is now beginning to implement RRR (School 2); and another in a relatively advantaged area that has partially implemented RRR (School 3). We assessed levels of school engagement\, optimism\, self-concept\, parental involvement\, school problems\, education and career aspirations\, and participation in school and community. Results: Compared with their peers in the other two schools\, students attending School 1 reported significantly higher levels of school engagement\, fewer social problems\, greater optimism and higher self-concepts.

The history of the MBW initiative also provides insight into the interaction of two contending models for organizing European Society\, namely 'Regulated Capitalism' and 'Neoliberalism' and the relationship of these models to partnership theory. This study argues that motivations for the development of partnerships in Belfast defy easy theoretical classification; yet empirical evidence suggests that a twin-track approach-one from above\, the European Union\, and one from below\, of indigenous policy evolution-have together through policy diffusion made MBW a leading pioneer in partnership theory and practice.

We investigate small-amplitude light variations in FU Ori occurring in timescales of days and weeks.\nAims. We seek to determine the mechanisms that lead to these light changes.\nMethods. The visual light curve of FU Ori gathered by the MOST satellite continuously for 55 days in the 2013-2014 winter season\nand simultaneously obtained ground-based multi-colour data were compared with the results from a disc and star light synthesis\nmodel.\nResults. Hotspots on the star are not responsible for the majority of observed light variations. Instead\, we found that the long periodic\nfamily of 10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag may arise owing to the rotational revolution\nof disc inhomogeneities located between 16-20 R⊙. The same distance is obtained by assuming that these light variations arise\nbecause of a purely Keplerian revolution of these inhomogeneities for a stellar mass of 0.7 M⊙. The short-periodic (∼ 3 − 1.38 d)\nsmall amplitude (∼ 0.01 mag) light variations show a clear sign of period shortening\, similar to what was discovered in the first MOST\nobservations of FU Ori. Our data indicate that these short-periodic oscillations may arise because of changing visibility of plasma\ntongues (not included in our model)\, revolving in the magnetospheric gap and/or likely related hotspots as well.\nConclusions. Results obtained for the long-periodic 10-11 d family of light variations appear to be roughly in line with the colourperiod relation\, which assumes that longer periods are produced by more external and cooler parts of the disc. Coordinated observations in a broad spectral range are still necessary to fully understand the nature of the short-periodic 1-3 d family of light variations\nand their period changes.",,"cbu:1574,doi: 10.1051/0004-6361/201833401,https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833401,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09134.pdf",,"Siwak\, Michał (author),Winiarski\, Maciej (author),Ogłoza\, Waldemar (author),Dróżdż\, Marek (author),Zoła\, Stanisław (author),Moffat\, Anthony F.J.

The null hypothesis that tree species and size do not differentiate soil pH was tested in four ways: (i) comparison of an evergreen conifer ecosystem with a history of elevated exposure to acidifying emissions vs. a deciduous angiosperm ecosystem in a rural area; (ii) soil trenching to exclude mineral nutrient and water uptake by trees in the two ecosystems; (iii) comparisons of soil pH and the accumulation of decomposed organic material on the soil surface (Oh) beneath boreal angiosperms\, boreal conifers\, and temperate angiosperms at the landscape level; and\, (iv) stand-level comparisons of large trees and small trees as a proxy for cumulative ecosystem effects. Results show for mature mixed forests on acid soils below pH 5 that tree species and size do not differentiate soil pH although varying tree species composition among forest stands differentiates the magnitude of acid rain impacts and indicates the disturbance history of forest vegetation at the landscape level. Low exchangeable base cation pools compared to annual turnover in foliage corroborates the notion of homoeostasis in mixed and structurally diverse natural forests. Natural conifer admixture in northern hardwoods moderates spring soil warming and thereby slows down element cycling. However\, conifer admixture does not exacerbate biogenic soil acidification.

cbu:132,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,,"This thesis challenges the exclusion of emotion from  philosophical accounts of moral reasoning by appealing  to Hume's account of sympathy. Persons are naturally inclined to generate emotions through sympathy with others\, but these natural responses have been omitted from philosophical accounts of morally worthy agents. I argue that moral theory ought to bring sympathy into  its accounts of both moral deliberation and moral motivation. Such an approach overturns a longstanding tradition in moral philosophy\, that which typically  excludes the emotions from moral reasoning. That  rejection of emotion stands on a long history of regarding the emotions as involuntary\, capricious   responses in the body which can only lead to nonautonomous action. By arguing that 'care' motivates moral action\, feminist care ethics challenges the traditional view that only reason motivates moral action. I show that an ethic of care is unsatisfactory as a complete moral theory\, partly because of its conception of the emotion of care. But I aim to  preserve three main aims of feminist ethics to which  care ethics appeals: (1) selves are inherently situated  in a context of relations; (2) moral reasoning is not  impartial; and (3) emotions are legitimate moral motives. I then argue against the traditional model of  moral reasoning for illegitimately granting primacy to  reason over emotion. Kant and Aristotle offer moral  theories paradigmatic of this approach to reason. The contemporary parallel is evident in Harry Frankfurt's  hierarchical model of moral motivation--or so I argue. The key idea present in the hierarchical model worth preserving is that reflection is central to moral reasoning. But that reflection need not consist of reasoning alone. I develop Hume's theory of sympathy to explain how emotions matter to moral reflection\, defending Hume's account against challenges from both feminist empathy and simulation theory. Then I expand  and enrich Hume's account on appeal to contemporary theories of the imagination and the emotions. If successful\, this thesis introduces a new way of  incorporating emotion into a theory of moral reasoning  in the form of a metaethical theory which encompasses  traditional and feminist moral philosophy alike.",,"cbu:132,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,isbn: 0612966550,cbu-department: Humanities",sympathy--morals--reasoning--emotions,"Burrow\, Sylvia (author)",Western Press,2002,Showing some humean sympathy: The role of emotion in moral reasoning,,"Text,Book\, Whole",,,,,1181,ir:citationCModel

Heteronormativity governs birthing spaces and presents considerable challenges for queer birthing women who may also have an increased risk of trauma due to structurally marginalising processes that create and maintain socially constructed differences.& para;& para;Design.

Bioactivity in food proteins and peptides is determined by their conformations and binding characteristics\, which in turn depend on their primary and secondary structures. To maintain their bioactivities\, the molecular integrity of bioactive peptides must remain intact\, and this warrants the study of peptide form and structure\, ideally with robust\, highly specific and sensitive techniques.

The study procedure includes\, amongst others\, a novel methodology for calculating density of fossil pinnules and rachides. This\, in conjunction with the trait relationships and mathematical models that linked density and material/structural properties established for modern plant-leaf tissues\, permits the estimation of tensile strength\, tensile modulus of elasticity\, flexural stiffness\, and leaf mass per area. Results suggest that\, theoretically\, (a) the living frond invested a considerable amount of resources for the construction of metabolically expensive\, hard\, tough\, and resistant pinnule and rachial tissues\, which were “made to last”\, and (b) were used as part of a combination of strategies that increased the plant's biomechanical stability. This translated in resistance to damage during the application of external loads such as those exerted by strong winds or tropical storms. High leaf mass per area (dry-mass investment) of pinnules and rachial tissues points to a slow photosynthetic return that was sustained for long periods of time (long leaf lifespan). The latter possibly indicates a plant adaptation to wet\, levee-top habitats\, which were characterized by nutrient-deficient soils exposed to intensive solar irradiation.

Although the exciton formation is similarly induced by photoexcitation of chromophore assemblies in phycocyanin (PC) and allophycocyanin (APC) in PBSs of both species\, the EET mechanisms are totally different\, being adiabatic in A. marina and nonadiabatic in T. vulcanus. The PBS of A. marina has only one APC trimer and energy transfer is through coupling of α84 in APC with β84 in adjacent PC. In T. vulcanus\, the PBS has three components: coupling between APC core and the entire PC rod and couplings of β–β18 and of LCM to β in the adjacent APC-like trimer. A total of 80% of the excitation energy is trapped in the coupling β–β18 and regulates the flow of energy from the high- to low-level terminal electronic transition emitter β-LCM. All these details cannot be observed at room temperature and in extracted units.",,"cbu:1590,doi: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00714,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00714,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-school: Research Centers and Others,cbu-department: Chemistry,cbu-department: Verschuren Centre",,"Nganou\, Collins (author),Adir\, Noam (author),Mkandawire\, Martin (author)",,2018-03-29,Cryospectroscopy Studies of Intact Light-Harvesting Antennas Reveal Empirical Electronic Energy Transitions in Two Cyanobacteria Species,,"Journal Article,Text",,,,,1196,ir:citationCModel

This study explored a group of Masters athletes’ and a group of youth athletes’ perspectives of their common canoe/kayak coach’s approaches\, with an aim to understand if and how the coach’s approaches differed based on the age cohort she was coaching. Four focus group interviews (two with each age cohort lasting 60–90 min) were conducted with nine youth (five male\, four female; 14–15 years old) and 12 Masters athletes (six male\, six female; 27–70 years old). Data were inductively analysed resulting in three higher order themes: (1) communication\, exchanges\, and interactions; (2) coaching on the basis of the athletes’ self-concept; (3) norms\, goals\, and expectations for learning within the climate. Results indicated that Masters athletes felt their coach responded well to their need for information\, gave them room to make decisions\, and engaged them in collaborative conversations. Youth athletes described their coach’s approaches as more directive: she made decisions for when and how they trained\, provided information linearly\, and maintained a climate of highly competitive expectations. Whereas coaching approaches with Masters athletes closely paralleled andragogical principles\, those for youth aligned with more directed instructional methods. Findings illustrate how one coach’s approaches varied on a continuum from coach-directed (i.e. traditional pedagogical) to athlete-directed (i.e. andragogical) styles\, both evident to some degree with each cohort.",,"cbu:1589,doi: 10.1177/1747954117727202,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1747954117727202,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Experiential Studies in Community and Sport",,"MacLellan\, Justin (author),Callary\, Bettina (author),Young\, Bradley W (author)",,2018-04-22,"Same coach\, different approach?

Music represents one of the most profound ways in which humanity struggles\, nevertheless\, to accommodate death within the scope of the living by giving a voice to death and the dead. This book engages with the question of how music expresses and responds to the profound existential disturbance that death and loss present to the living. ‘Singing Death’ ranges across genres from medieval love song to twenty-first century horror film music.Each chapter offers readers an encounter with music as a distinct way of speaking or responding to human mortality. The chapters cover a wide range of disciplines: musicology\, ethnomusicology\, literature\, history\, philosophy\, film studies\, psychology and psychoanalysis. Each chapter\, in its own way\, addresses these questions: How does music place or symbolise the dead for the living? Conversely\, how does music express a failure in their placement?

cbu:670,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Journal of the History of Biology--0022-5010,"In the nineteenth century protozoology and early cell biology intersected through the nexus of Darwin's theory of evolution. As single-celled organisms\, amoebae offered an attractive focus of study for researchers seeking evolutionary relationships between the cells of humans and other animals\, and their primitive appearance made them a favourite model for the ancient ancestor of all living things. Their resemblance to human and other metazoan cells made them popular objects of study among morphologists\, physiologists\, and even those investigating animal behaviour. The amoeba became the exemplar of the new protoplasmic cell concept of mid-century and because its apparent simplicity made it widely generalizable it became a popular subject in a breadth of experimental investigations and theoretical speculations. It was able to do this because ""the amoeba"" denotes not a particular organism\, but a general type of behaviour common to the cells of a range of protozoa\, simple plants and higher animals. Its status as an exemplary cell also rested upon auxiliary philosophical assumptions about what constitutes a primitive characteristic and the thesis that evolution is a progressive development of order from chaos.",,"cbu:670,citekey: Reynolds2008,doi: 10.1007/s10739-007-9142-8,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Humanities","evolution,life,amoebae,cell theory,Ernst Haeckel,exemplary materials,Michael Foster,protoplasm,T.

We argue that this two stage process is a fiction and that a distinction must be drawn between pure science and science in the service of public policy. When science is transferred into the policy realm\, its claims to truth get undermined because we must abandon the open-ended nature of scientific inquiry. When we move from the sphere of science to the sphere of policy\, we pick an arbitrary point in the open-ended scientific process\, and ask our experts to give us the answer. The choice of the endpoint\, however\, must always be arbitrary and determined by non-scientific factors. Thus\, the two stages in the model of first finding the facts\, and then making a decision about what to do\, cannot be clearly separated. The second stage clearly affects the first. This conclusion will have implications about existing scientific policy institutions. For example\, we advocate that the environmental assessment process be radically overhauled\, or perhaps even let go. It will be our position that ultimately a better model for the involvement of scientists in public policy debates is that of being participants in particular interest groups (""hired guns"")\, rather than as supposedly unbiased consultants to decision-makers.",,"cbu:712,citekey: Haller2007,doi: 10.1007/s10806-006-9027-4,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Humanities","public policy,science,environmental assessment,environment,philosophy,public participation","Haller\, Stephen (author),Gerrie\, James (author)",,2007,"The role of science in public policy: Higher reason\, or reason for hire?",,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1242,ir:citationCModel

In Channeling Wonder: Fairy Tales on Television\, Pauline Greenhill and Jill Terry Rudy offer contributions that invite readers to consider what happens when fairy tale\, a narrative genre that revels in variation\, joins the flow of television experience. Looking in detail at programs from Canada\, France\, Italy\, Japan\, the UK\, and the U.S.\, this volume's twenty-three international contributors demonstrate the wide range of fairy tales that make their way into televisual forms.\nThe writers look at fairy-tale adaptations in musicals like Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella\, anthologies like Jim Henson's The Storyteller\, made-for-TV movies like Snow White: A Tale of Terror\, Bluebeard\, and the Red Riding Trilogy\, and drama serials like Grimm and Once Upon a Time. Contributors also explore more unexpected representations in the Carosello commercial series\, the children's show Super Why!\, the anime series Revolutionary Girl Utena\, and the live-action dramas Train Man and Rich Man Poor Woman. In addition\, they consider how elements from familiar tales\, including ""Hansel and Gretel\,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood\,"" ""Beauty and the Beast\,"" ""Snow White\,"" and ""Cinderella"" appear in the long arc serials Merlin\, Buffy the Vampire Slayer\, and Dollhouse\, and in a range of television formats including variety shows\, situation comedies\, and reality TV.\nChanneling Wonder demonstrates that fairy tales remain ubiquitous on TV\, allowing for variations but still resonating with the wonder tale's familiarity.

Here we make the case that a prerequisite to meaningful participation is providing children with an early environments conducive to creating the capacity to participate within the child. Early environments have a profound impact on children’s brain development and as such on their motivation and capacity to exercise their participation rights. We believe that insufficient attention has been paid to preparing children neurologically for meaningful participation in matters that affect them. After summarizing brain development in early childhood\, we make the case that active listening which acts as sensory stimulation for the developing brain\, and active learning\, which builds confidence\, self-esteem\, and problem-solving skills\, play key roles in promoting children’s cognitive and motivational capacity for meaningful participation. Participation is meant to promote self-determination through the capacity to make effective decisions about self and others.

cbu:1566,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Fisheries Research--Fisheries Research--01657836,"The waved whelk (Buccinum undatum) is commercially fished in the North Atlantic Ocean; the fishery is growing in Atlantic Canada. The species’ oviparous reproduction limits dispersal\, posing a challenge to fishery management at the meta-population level. The Minimum Landing Size (MLS) for B. undatum in Nova Scotia is set at 65 mm with intent to maintain an adequate spawning stock. The implicit assumption that the MLS approximates a size at which half the population has reached reproductive maturity (LM50) is unjustified. We measured the LM50 of the whelks sampled from commercial fishing catches during 2016 and 2017 at five sites on the Eastern Scotian Shelf located roughly 11–210 km apart. There were significant differences among all measured parameters including total shell length\, LM50\, sex ratio and parasitic prevalence. The latter was measured to investigate its effects on calculations of LM50 and fishery regulations. The LM50 was smaller than the MLS at all sites. The LM50 for males ranged 45–64 mm\, and 53–65 mm for females. The age at LM50 was found to be consistent with other studies: 5–6 years for both sexes. The size-frequency distributions in most samples were approximately normally distributed. The sex ratio was within the range found in other studies but varied among sampling sites. The prevalence of castrating trematodes was found to be 2–26% in males and 5–25% in females. We suggest that the area-based\, effort management model for the fishery should adopt locale-specific MLS values based on the LM50 determined for sub-populations being exploited within specific areas of fishing access.",,"cbu:1566,doi: 10.1016/j.fishres.2018.11.025,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165783618303345,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology",waved whelk--Buccinum--reproductive technology--size at maturity--whelk fishery,"Ashfaq\, Umair (author),Mugridge\, Adam (author),Hatcher\, Bruce G.

Appearing first to be the planula larva of an invertebrate marine animal further observation revealed it to be a colony of flagellated cells with a complex life cycle transitioning between multicellular and single-cell stages and several distinct forms of protozoa. Haeckel named it Magosphaera planula (the ""magician's ball"") and it eventually assumed a central role in his theories of animal evolution\, appearing as the modern exemplar of the blastaea stage in his gastraea theory of metazoan evolution. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth it was an object of considerable scientific interest\, and yet it was only ever observed by Haeckel himself and then only the once. Eventually it faded altogether from scientific discussion. This paper traces the rise and fall of Magosphaera as an important epistemic object in the theories of Haeckel and other biologists\, and an a:tempt is made to identify what exactly the organism (or organisms!) was that Haeckel observed in the fall of 1869.",,"cbu:684,citekey: Reynolds2008,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Humanities","evolution,morphology,applied metaphysics,biography of a scientific   object,evolution of multicellularity,Gastraea theory,historical ontology,protists,protozoa","Reynolds\, Andrew (author),Huelsmann\, Norbert (author)",,2008,Ernst Haeckel's Discovery of Magosphaera planula: A Vestige of Metazoan Origins?,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1287,ir:citationCModel

The residential real estate decision offers opportunities for sellers to appeal to those motivated by justice.\n\nPractical implications\nPolicymakers should consider ways of easing these barriers for those consumers who a financially unable to satisfy their justice motivation when purchasing a home as well as bolstering regulatory enforcement. Sellers should clearly articulate functional explanations of features as well as benefits to enhance the cognitive processing of the sustainable home as a choice alternative.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper makes a unique contribution by arguing that the social psychology theory of justice motivation helps explain the role of sustainability in the residential real estate purchase decision-making process.",,"cbu:1808,doi: 10.1108/IJHMA-08-2019-0082,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJHMA-08-2019-0082/full/html,cbu-school: Shannon School of Business",marketing--sustainability--housing--North America--house market--buying,"Nadeau\, John (author),Wardley\, Leslie (author),Dorohoi\, Alexander (author)",,2019-10-18,Justice motivation theory in sustainable home purchases,,"Journal Article,Text",,,,,1331,ir:citationCModel

The study was based on data from 148 French-speaking Cameroonian university students using a Data completion task questionnaire. The analysis focused on the pragmatic functions\, realization patterns\, and situational distribution of thanks response strategies as well as on supportive acts used to modify thanks responses. The results indicate five groups of thanks response strategies emerging from the corpus and the most common strategies used by the respondents are those intended to mitigate or even negate the magnitude of the favor. The findings also show that thanks response strategies are realized in different ways and that they are distributed differently across the three situations retained for this study. It was also found that thanks responses occur either as single acts or as combinations of many acts.

The area also contains the boundary between Avalonia and Ganderia as interpreted in the northern Appalachian orogen. New detrital zircon ages reported here provide improved understanding of depositional ages and provenance of diverse Neoproterozoic to Carboniferous rocks in this complex area. Detrital zircon data from samples with Neoproterozoic maximum depositional ages indicate a dominantly Gondwanan provenance with strong influence from the Amazonian craton. However\, quartzite from The Thoroughfare Formation on Grand Manan Island contains dominanly 2 Ga zircon grains\, consistent with derivation from the West African craton. The age spectrum is similar to that of the Hutchins Island Quartzite in the Isleboro block in Penobscot Bay\, Maine\, strengthening the possibility of correlation between the two areas. Cambrian samples also show prominent peri-Gondwanan provenance with strong influence from Ediacaran to early Cambrian arc magmatism. The maximum depositional ages of these samples are consistent with previous interpretations of Cambrian ages based on fossil correlations and field data. A Carboniferous sample from Avalonia shows a significant contribution from Devonian magmatism as the youngest detrital component\, although its depositional age based on field relationships is Carboniferous.

cbu:1801,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Hydrology,"Waste rock piles (WRPs) are commonly remediated with cover systems to limit water and oxygen influx and mitigate the impacts of acid mine drainage (AMD) on the environment. While numerous types of cover systems exist\, simple\, single-layer soil covers remain an attractive option due to their low cost and simplicity of installation. Since knowledge of their long-term performance in humid climates is limited\, this study was undertaken to assess and predict a single-layer cover system at a WRP in Nova Scotia\, Canada. A two-dimensional finite element model was developed to simulate variably saturated flow and solute transport at the WRP and surrounding area. Key parameters collected during five years of field monitoring\, including moisture contents\, groundwater levels and dissolved metal concentrations\, were used to produce a well-calibrated and verified model. Early results confirm that the cover system has already decreased AMD into both groundwater (reduced water infiltration/seepage in the WRP) and surface water (eliminated contaminated surface water runoff). Long-term acidity depletion rates indicate that all sulphidic minerals within the pile will be oxidized within 34 years\, but due to the slow leaching rates into water\, it will take over 9000 years to deplete all acidity. Numerical simulations predict the evolution of groundwater and surface water quality over time until full acidity depletion. Current work involves kinetic tests on waste rock samples to more accurately access the annual generation and release of AMD.",,"cbu:1801,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Verschuren Centre,doi: 10.3390/hydrology6040083",contaminant--remediation--cover system--FEFLOW--acidity--variability saturated flow--environmental monitoring,"Ramasamy\, Murugan (author),Power\, Christopher (author)",,,Evolution of acid mine drainage from a coal waste rock pile reclaimed with as Simple soil cover,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1334,ir:citationCModel

Mathematical models for multi capacitated supply chain network design provide a finite set of capacity levels from which to choose; and include variables and constraints to ensure the selection of a single capacity level for each facility to be built. By eliminating the constraints that enforce a single capacity selection\, we allow for the selection of several capacity levels for a single plant or warehouse. If such a selection occurs\, the plant or warehouse is built with size equal to the sum of the selected capacity levels. This gives an exponential increase in the number of available capacity levels.

Data were obtained through written discourse completion tasks by a group of Canadian learners of French as a second language\, a group of L1 French speakers\, and a group of English native speakers. The aim was to compare offer refusal strategies in French L1\, French L2\, and English L1 and to locate traces of pragmatic transfer in L2 French refusal behavior. Significant differences were found between the French L1 speakers and the French L2 learners with respect to the use of direct refusals\, indirect refusals\, and adjuncts to refusals. For instance\, it was found that the French L2 learners use a very limited repertoire of linguistic realizations to express the inability to accept offers. At the level of indirect refusals\, the results reveal some similarities between the L2 French learners\, the L1 French speakers\, and the L1 English speakers: the three groups use reasons more often than any other strategy in their refusal utterances. Differences emerge\, however\, in the linguistic realization of this pragmatic category. Implications of the findings for L2 French pedagogy were also discussed.",,"cbu:1788,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Communication and Languages,https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/offer-refusals-in-l2-french,doi: 10.5772/intechopen.87189",interlanguage pragmatics--offer refusals--L2 French--variation--canadian context,"Farenkia\, Bernard Mulo (author)",,,Offer refusals in L2 French,CC-BY,"Text,Book\, Section",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:1788/datastream/PDF/download,1396,ir:citationCModel

The physical properties of the resultant mp-Si generated via magnesiothermic reduction\, and thus the potential utility\, are highly dependent on the specific reduction conditions utilized. Herein\, we report a modified magnesiothermic reduction method which allows for the synthesis of high surface area mp-Si nanoparticles. The reaction was initiated at 650 ºC and then cooled to a lower temperature to minimize heat induced morphological damage. The nanoparticles were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction\, scanning and transmission electron microscopies\, and N2 adsorption isotherm measurements. Particles prepared using two-step annealing with the initial processing condition of 650 ºC for 30 min followed by 300 ºC for 4 h resulted in crystalline and completely reduced mp-Si with a high specific surface area of 542 ± 18 m2/g. mp-Si nanoparticles generated using these specific parameters were further used for stoichiometric CO2 conversion to CH3OH and the reaction yields were 2.5x higher than prior reports\, demonstrating usefulness in effecting an important chemical transformation.",,"cbu:1792,doi: 10.1021/acsanm.9b01207,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.9b01207,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Chemistry,https://login.ezproxy.cbu.ca/login?url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01207",chemistry,"Martell\, Sarah (author),Lai\, Yiqi (author),Traver\, Emily (author),MacInnis\, Judy (author),Richards\, D.

cbu:1840,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Atlantic Geology,"The Margaree pluton extends for approximately 40 km along the NNE-SSW axis of the Ganderian Aspy terrane of northern Cape Breton Island. Typically described in the literature as rapakivi-textured megacrystic syenogranite\, detailed mapping has shown that the pluton can be subdivided into mappable units of (1) megacrystic syenogranite; (2) medium-grained\, equigranular\, biotite syenogranite; and (3) microgranite porphyry\, all locally displaying rapakivi texture. The equigranular syenogranite intruded megacrystic syenogranite\, and the porphyry intruded both granites. The units are locally mingled\, consistent with similar U–Pb (zircon) ages of 363.0 ± 1.6 Ma from a megacrystic syenogranite sample\, 364.8 ± 1.6 Ma from an equigranular syenogranite sample\, and 365.5 ± 3.3 Ma from a microgranite porphyry sample. Although the pluton displays wide textural variation\, chemical data from 50 samples collected throughout the pluton show similar trends. The Margaree pluton is peraluminous and ferroan\, with an alkalic to calc-alkalic signature. The REE patterns for the three units that compose the pluton are virtually identical\, with parallel trends characterized by enrichment in the LREE (La 20 to 100 times chondritic values)\, flat HREE\, and moderate negative Eu anomalies. The observed variability in major element composition and textural features can be explained by the interaction of felsic and mafic magmas in the magma chamber\, followed by fractionation of alkali feldspar\, plagioclase\, and quartz. The geochemical signature suggests that the pluton is an evolved I-type granite\, a surprising signature given the ca. 365 Ma age and its location in an area presumed to be in an extensional regime since ca. 375 Ma. This apparent conundrum can be untangled by a combination of geochemistry and field relations. The Margaree pluton is highly enriched in heat-producing elements (HPE). Combined with the intrusion of mafic magmas in the Aspy terrane at the time\, as evidenced by the textural features of the Margaree pluton and characteristics of coeval supracrustal units\, the enrichment in HPE provides the engine for anatexis. The isotopic (Sm-Nd\, Pb\, Hf\, and O systematics) signature of the Margaree pluton is consistent with melting of pre-existing igneous rocks from the continental crust. This magma produced by crustal recycling migrated to high crustal levels in the area where the Aspy Fault intersected the Western Highlands Shear Zone\, as indicated by the en-cornue geometry of the pluton\, with tails at the intersection point of both structures\, during Late Devonian extension in the Aspy terrane.",,"cbu:1840,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology",,"Sombini Dos Santos\, Gabriel (author),Barr\, Sandra M.

cbu:1836,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Atlantic Geology,"Mineralogical associations within rare metal-enriched igneous bodies provide insight into the late-magmatic cooling conditions and fluid evolution of these systems. Rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE) collectively represent most of the elements known as rare metals. Highly differentiated peralkaline systems commonly achieve enrichment in rare metals sufficient to promote growth of exotic accessory minerals that are intrinsically composed of these elements. The REE-bearing fluorocarbonate mineral bastnäsite ((Ce\,La)CO3F) is one such accessory mineral commonly found in systems host to rare metal mineralization. The Flowers River Igneous Suite of north-central Labrador comprises an intrusive ring complex of rare metal-enriched alkali granites and their comagmatic volcanic equivalents. Both intrusive and extrusive Flowers River lithotypes exhibit the same geochemical and mineralogical hallmarks of other silica-oversaturated rocks that host rare metal occurrences. Bastnäsite (Ce) is the dominant repository of REE in the Flowers River Igneous Suite. The distribution of bastnäsite in Flowers River rocks displays three distinct associations: (i) as a pseudomorph of allanite in alkali granites; (ii) proximal to Fe-rich minerals interstitial to cumulate quartz and feldspar or within Ferich chloritized domains in plutonic and volcanic rocks\, respectively; and (iii) filling elated exotic mineral phases such as parisite (Ca(Ce\,La)2(CO3)3F2). Further\, pervasive Na depletion in the Flowers River volcanic rocks has been observed to accompany the alteration of groundmass albite to chlorite. In-situ replacement of allanite by bastnäsite suggests a primary magmatic contribution to enrichment of rare metals that was followed by alteration and remobilization by CO2-rich fluids. A sporadic association of bastnäsite with hydrothermal fluorite supports a high activity of F in these fluids\, a property that would enhance the hydrothermal system’s capacity to mobilize REE. These criteria\, taken together\, indicate a deuteric or secondary hydrothermal control on the alteration of primary host mineralsand on the redistribution of rare metals within the Flowers River Igneous Suite.",,"cbu:1836,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology",,"Ducharme\, Taylor A.

Open textbooks provide an alternative to the traditional publishing model and a partial solution to the problem of high textbook prices. Open textbooks are produced and distributed under a Creative Commons license\, making them freely available to use and modify. (They may be used free digitally or printed locally at cost.) In addition to savings\, the ability to adapt textbook content to make it regionally relevant allows instruction to be consciously “place based”\, increasing student engagement by emphasizing community connections\, highlighting local examples\, and integrating local First Nations’ traditional knowledge. This is of particular value in Atlantic Canada\, a region often poorly represented in “Canadian edition” introductory geology textbooks. Building an open textbook from the ground up is labour intensive\, but an up-to-date textbook already exists that could act as a foundation for an Atlantic edition: Physical Geology\, released in 2015 by the BCcampus Open Textbook Project\, and modified for use by the University of Saskatchewan in 2018.

Correlations between the LPE of biochars and different solvent parameters are established\, and surface modification of biochars has potential to increase their exfoliation in more benign solvents. The LPE of oxidized biochars is more efficient in hydrogen-bond-accepting solvents due to the increased concentration of functional groups on their surface.

Employment Insurance Sick Benefits (EI-SB) is a social income support program which provides temporary income replacement to Canadians when they fall ill. Although EI-SB is designed to maintain continuity of income during an illness\, little is known about the perspectives of cancer patients who receive EI-SB. This knowledge can inform the development of public policies which are responsive to the needs and priorities of cancer patients.\n\nMethods \nWe conducted a theory-informed thematic analysis of data collected from twenty semi- structured interviews with participants who were receiving care in a cancer centre in Cape Breton\, Nova Scotia and had received EI-SB. A coding framework was developed using Taplin and colleagues’ intermediate outcomes of patient care across the cancer care continuum. Interpretation of findings was guided by the synergies of oppression theoretical lens.\n\nResults \nThree overarching themes describe the experiences of cancer patients receiving social income support: Economic exclusion\, in which the structure of the labour market and social welfare system determine access to workplace benefits and continuity of reasonable income; financial toxicity\, a vicious cycle of financial burden and increasing financial distress; and constrained choices\, where cancer influences employability and lowered income influences the need to be employed.\n\nConclusion \nCancer patients need income support programs that are tailored to match their healthcare priorities. In addition\, policies which strengthen working conditions and facilitate a reintegration to work when possible will be important in addressing the structural drivers of income insecurity experienced by cancer patients.",,"cbu:2053,doi: 10.34172/IJHPM.2021.83,http://www.ijhpm.com/article_4095.html,cbu-school: School of Nursing,cbu-department: Nursing",Canada--cancer--income security--financial toxicity--social benefits--income replacement,"Sayani\, Ambreen (author),Dilney\, Jessica (author),Kuhnke\, Janet L.

The groundwater from open wells and soil from agricultural land was examined continuously for three years (2015\, 2016 and 2017) in order to assess the existing environment status along Noyyal river basin in Tiruppur. The GIS study reveals that 71% of groundwater remains unsuitable for drinking and also 54% are unfit for irrigation use. The findings further reveal that 61% of surface and 20% of subsurface soils are not suitable for agriculture. The detailed investigations established that the open wells located in the downstream of textile industries and near to Orathupalayam reservoir are highly contaminated with organic and inorganic contaminants associated with textile processing activities. The temporal variation of groundwater in these open wells indicated that the dilution by rainwater is very slow.

Free Fe3+ and its complexes (Fe(HSO4)2+\, Fe(SO4)2– and FeSO4+ were responsible for Cu dissolution\, which increased with increasing pH and temperature.

However\, little research has examined the association between these constructs longitudinally. Data from 339 children assessed annually from kindergarten to 2nd grade were examined to determine the developmental trajectory of ERP indices of performance monitoring\, and whether the association between these indices changes across time. EEG data were recorded during an incentivized Go/No-Go task and ERP component amplitudes were extracted as peak measures at Fz. Despite small increases in magnitude\, no significant changes were observed in any of the ERPs. Multi-level regression analyses indicated that in kindergarten a more negative feedback-related negativity (FRN) was associated with a more negative error-related negativity (ERN) and a more negative error positivity (Pe). Further\, the association between the FRN and Pe changed over time\, such that in 2nd grade the FRN and Pe decoupled from one another and were no longer associated. These results suggest that the development of performance monitoring through middle childhood may be a phasic process.

However\, existing descriptions and measures of hyperfocus might tap into related constructs like perseveration and/or flow. Furthermore\, previous studies have not sufficiently accounted for comorbidities like depression when examining the specificity of hyperfocus to ADHD. Therefore\, the present study investigated the relations between hyperfocus\, perseveration\, and flow from a transdiagnostic emotion dysregulation perspective to facilitate insights into the separate associations between the attentional and emotional components of ADHD and hyperfocus-like experiences. In a nonclinical sample (neither ADHD nor another mental health diagnosis reported\, n = 186)\, the following were examined: (a) the correlation between ADHD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation tendencies\, (b) the similarities between hyperfocus\, perseveration\, and flow measures\, and (c) the predictability of phenomena scores by ADHD symptomatology over and above emotion dysregulation tendencies. Then\, the scores of 26 clinical participants (i.e.\, self-reported ADHD with or without comorbidities) and a matched sample of 26 nonclinical participants were compared to examine the clinical specificity of hyperfocus\, perseveration\, and flow. The results replicated existing findings regarding the clinical specificity of hyperfocus and its relation to ADHD symptomatology. The results also extended the literature by confirming a more perseveration-like approach to the conceptualization and measurement of hyperfocus in the existing literature\, although ADHD symptomatology accounted for more unique variance in hyperfocus scores than in perseveration scores.

At the beginning of each week\, over a 4-week period\, 11 elite S&C coaches were sent a short video vignette clip of an S&C coach’s practice. They subsequently engaged in daily reflections in which they were guided to explore how the topic of the vignette aligned (or not) with their coaching practice. After the intervention\, each S&C coach was interviewed regarding their process of learning from the vignette and from their reflections. Using a holistic narrative analysis of form and structure\, the results exemplified three narrative types: performance\, achievement\, and helper. The S&C coaches whose reflections fitted the performance narrative type focused on their own practice\, with limited consideration of the athletes’ perspective or the vignette. The S&C coaches whose reflections fitted the achievement narrative type strove to accomplish goals with their athletes and were selective in considering the vignette. The S&C coaches whose reflections fit the helper narrative type found that the vignette helped them consider an athlete-centered coaching approach focusing on the athletes’ well-being\, as well as athletic abilities.

It is a great challenge to treat and provide safe water to the society. The conventional treatment methods are energy and cost intensive. These limitations can be subsided by the application of nanotechnology that shows better efficiency in terms of treatment of wastewater.The use of nanoparticles increases the adsorption of dye and removal efficiency due to their smaller size and increased Surface to Volume (S/V) ratio. In this paper\, magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized using Reverse Co-Precipitation method and their textile dye removal efficiency using adsorption was studied in treatment of blue dye water. The synthesized magnetite nanoparticles were qualitatively and quantitively characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM)\, UV-Vis Spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The observed continuous absorption spectral band by FTIR and UV-Vis spectrum confirmed the formation of magnetite nanoparticles. The magnetite nanoparticles observed in FESEM exhibited spherical shape with size of 60-100nm. The specific capacitance of the magnetics nanoparticles observed through CV was 1828.5mA/g.

In hopes of promoting and facilitating outdoor learning as a pedagogy in order to both increase our connection to Nature and improve teacher well-being\, this study sought to discover how a teacher’s use of outdoor learning contributes to his or her well-being. I also investigate how outdoor learning aligns with the attributes of new pedagogies. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design with a participant selection model (Creswell & Plano Clark\, 2018) was used to research the questions. 66 Canadian teachers responded to a survey\, which revealed significant correlations between teacher well-being and their use of outdoor and Nature-based pedagogy. The Teacher Flourishing Scale was developed for this survey; results from this measure correlated significantly with a teacher’s use of new pedagogies.\nSemi-structured interviews with 10 of the 66 respondents revealed three main themes that contribute to an explanation of the quantitative results: 1a) Fulfilment through authentic pedagogies; 1b) Outdoor learning as an authentic pedagogy; 2) Relationships; and 3) Natural spaces and well-being. The study confirmed that outdoor learning is a “new pedagogy” that contributes to relationship-building\, fulfilment\, meaning and engagement for teachers.

cbu:228,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Journal of Clinical Nursing--0962-1067,"Aims and objectives. To explore experiences of chronically ill patients and registered nurses when they negotiate patient care in hospital settings. Specifically\, we explored how social and institutional discourses shape power relations during the negotiation process. Background. The hospital system is embedded in a hierarchical structure where the voice of the healthcare provider as expert is often given more importance than the patient. This system has been criticised as being oppressive to patients who are perceived to be lower in the hierarchy. In this study\, we illustrate how the hospital's hierarchical system is not always oppressing but can also create moments of empowerment for patients. Design. A feminist poststructuralist approach informed by the teaching of Foucault was used to explore power relations between nurses and patients when negotiating patient care in hospital settings. Methods. Eight individuals who suffered from chronic illness shared their stories about how they negotiated their care with nurses in hospital settings. The interviews were tape-recorded. Discourse analysis was used to analyse the data. Results and Conclusions. Patients recounted various experiences when their voices were not heard because the current hospital system privileged the healthcare provider experts' advice over the patients' voice. The hierarchical structure of hospital supported these dynamics by privileging nurses as gatekeepers of service\, by excluding the patients' input in the nursing notes and through a process of self-regulation. However\, patients in this study were not passive recipients of care and used their agency creatively to resist these discourses. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses need to be mindful of how the hospital's hierarchical system tends to place nurses in a position of power\, and how their authoritative position may positively or adversely affect the negotiation of patient care.",,"cbu:228,citekey: Griscti2017,doi: 10.1111/jocn.13382,cbu-school: School of Education and Health,cbu-department: Nursing","participation,nurses,discourse,cardiac rehabilitation,chronic care model,chronic illness,chronically ill patients,discourse analysis,feminist   poststructuralism,kyriarchy,negotiation of patient care,nursing documentation,partnership,perspective,power   relations,self","Griscti\, Odette (author),Aston\, Megan (author),Warner\, Grace (author),Martin-Misener\, Ruth (author),McLeod\, Deborah (author)",,2017,Power and resistance within the hospital's hierarchical system: the experiences of chronically ill patients,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1476,ir:citationCModel

Design: Secondary multiple regression analysis of a subset of variables from a larger longitudinal study that examined adolescent mothers and infants. Setting: Two university teaching hospitals in Western Canada. Participants: Convenience sample of 78 healthy adolescent mothers. Main Outcome Measures: Prenatal anticipated infant care emotionality\, perceived family and friend social support\, socioeconomic status\, enacted social support\, and postpartum depressive symptoms. Results: Anticipated infant care emotionality (R-2 = .19) and socioeconomic status (R-2 = .07) significantly predicted postpartum depressive symptoms.. Family support\, friend support\, and enacted social support were not significant predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Nurses in various settings can assess the pregnant adolescent's anticipated infant care emotionality and socioeconomic status to determine their potential risk or vulnerability to postpartum depressive symptoms. More negative prenatal infant care emotionality was the strongest predictor of postpartum depressive symptoms.

To improve costs and wound outcomes of home care in Nova Scotia\, dedicated home care professionals collaborated with the Nova Scotia Department of Health Clinical Issues Committee in a four-phase endeavor In Phase I\, a descriptive\, retrospective chart review (1995-1999) was conducted using an Outcomes Management Model research framework to assess existing wound prevalence\, costs\, and outcomes of care in the Nova Scotia Home Care setting. In Phase II\, using literature-based best available evidence\, the Nova Scotia Standardized Prevention and Treatment Protocol was developed. In Phase III\, the Protocol was disseminated to 20 Nova Scotia healthcare agencies educated on its use. Wound care outcomes and costs were measured in Phase IV using a prospective\, quasi-experimental\, descriptive study design. The study found that before 1999\, Nova Scotia Home Care wound care practices were costly and outdated\, yielding sporadically recorded\, often inferior\, outcomes - eg\, 30% of patients had pressure ulcers\, 42% received daily home care visits\, and of the 115 (24.6%) clients with venous leg ulcers only 16 received compression therapy.

This manuscript describes the Community Profile Survey (CPS)\, a community-based\, national-level survey designed to identify and describe existing healthcare delivery\, funding models\, and diabetes specific infrastructure and programs in Indigenous communities.\n\nMethods\nThe CPS was developed collaboratively through FORGE AHEAD and the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada. Regional and federal engagement and partnerships were built with Indigenous organizations to establish regionally-tailored distribution of the 8-page CPS to 440 First Nations communities. Results were collected (one survey per community) and reported in strata by region\, with descriptive analyses performed on all variables. Results were shared with participating communities and regional/federal partners through tailored reports.\n\nResults\nA total of 84 communities completed the survey (19% response rate). The majority of communities had a health centre/office to provide service to their patients with diabetes\, with limited on-reserve hospitals for ambulatory or case-sensitive conditions. Few healthcare specialists were located on-site\, with patients frequently travelling off-site (> 40 km) for diabetes-related complications. The majority of healthcare professionals on-site were Health Directors\, Community Health Nurses\, and Home Care Nurses. Many communities had a diabetes registry but few reported a diabetes surveillance system. Regional variation in healthcare services\, diabetes programs\, and funding models were noted\, with most communities engaging in some type of innovative strategy to improve care for patients with diabetes.\n\nConclusions\nThe CPS is the first community-based\, national-level survey of its kind in Canada. Although the response rate was low\, the CPS was distributed and successfully administered across a broad range of First Nations communities\, and future considerations would benefit from a governance structure and leadership that strengthens community engagement\, and a longitudinal research approach to increase the representativeness of the data.

cbu:1502,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Education in the North,"In February 2017\, 26 Inuit educators gathered in Nain\, Nunatsiavut for the Inuit Education Forum. Teachers from each of the four Inuit regions in Canada were invited to share their experiences on education in Inuit Nunangat with the goal of identifying barriers and promising practices occurring within their communities. One of the key themes arising from these conversations was the ongoing need for Inuit teacher support and development in schools. Training and retaining Inuit teachers is problematic in Canada\, while research tells us that both of these factors are key to student success. Some key challenges impacting resilience for teachers identified by the Inuit Education Forum participants were: organization of learning and leadership\, prioritization of Inuit language and culture in schools\, and negotiations of teachers’ isolation and autonomy. These challenges and the solutions offered by participants are discussed in the Canadian historical context implications for teacher training and professional development in Inuit Nunangat are highlighted.",,"cbu:1502,cbu-school: School of Education and Health,cbu-department: Education,https://www.abdn.ac.uk/eitn/journal/547/",,"O'Gorman\, Melanie (author),Ochalski\, Heather (author),Snow\, Kathy (author),Tulloch\, Shelly (author)",,,"Reconciliation\, resilience and resistance in Inuit teacher's professional development and practices",,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1503,ir:citationCModel

These changes impact human health and well-being\, and resultantly\, climate change has been identified as the biggest global health threat of the 21st Century. Recently\, research is beginning to indicate that changes in climate\, and the subsequent disruption to the social\, economic\, and environmental determinants of health\, may cause increased incidences and prevalence of mental health issues\, emotional responses\, and large-scale sociopsychological changes. Through a multi-year\, community-led\, exploratory case study conducted in Rigolet\, Nunatsiavut\, Labrador\, Canada\, this research qualitatively explores the impacts of climate change on mental health and well-being in an Inuit context. Drawing from 67 in-depth interviews conducted between January 2010 and October 2010 with community members and local and regional health professionals\, participants reported that changes in weather\, snow and ice stability and extent\, and wildlife and vegetation patterns attributed to climate change were negatively impacting mental health and well-being due to disruptions in land-based activities and a loss of place-based solace and cultural identity. Participants reported that changes in climate and environment increased family stress\, enhanced the possibility of increased drug and alcohol usage\, amplified previous traumas and mental health stressors\, and were implicated in increased potential for suicide ideation.

cbu:436,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Bmc Health Services Research--1472-6963,"Background: Home care (HC) is a critical component of the ongoing restructuring of healthcare in Canada. It impacts three dimensions of healthcare delivery: primary healthcare\, chronic disease management\, and aging at home strategies. The purpose of our study is to investigate a significant safety dimension of HC\, the occurrence of adverse events and their related outcomes. The study reports on the incidence of HC adverse events\, the magnitude of the events\, the types of events that occur\, and the consequences experienced by HC clients in the province of Ontario. Methods: A retrospective cohort design was used\, utilizing comprehensive secondary databases available for Ontario HC clients from the years 2008 and 2009. The data were derived from the Canadian Home Care Reporting System\, the Hospital Discharge Abstract Database\, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System\, the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System\, and the Continuing Care Reporting System. Descriptive analysis was used to identify the type and frequency of the adverse events recorded and the consequences of the events. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between the events and their consequences. Results: The study found that the incident rate for adverse events for the HC clients included in the cohort was 13%. The most frequent adverse events identified in the databases were injurious falls\, injuries from other than a fall\, and medication-related incidents. With respect to outcomes\, we determined that an injurious fall was associated with a significant increase in the odds of a client requiring long-term-care facility admission and of client death. We further determined that three types of events\, delirium\, sepsis\, and medication-related incidents were associated directly with an increase in the odds of client death. Conclusions: Our study concludes that 13% of clients in homecare experience an adverse event annually. We also determined that an injurious fall was the most frequent of the adverse events and was associated with increased admission to long-term care or death. We recommend the use of tools that are presently available in Canada\, such as the Resident Assessment Instrument and its Clinical Assessment Protocols\, for assessing and mitigating the risk of an adverse event occurring.",,"cbu:436,citekey: Doran2013,doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-13-227,cbu-school: School of Education and Health,cbu-department: Nursing","infection,mortality,community,system,catheter,mds-hc,older-people","Doran\, Diane (author),Hirdes\, John (author),Blais\, Regis (author),Baker\, G (author),Poss\, Jeff (author),Li\, Xiaoqiang (author),Dill\, Donna (author),Gruneir\, Andrea (author),Heckman\, George (author),Lacroix\, Helene (author),Mitchell\, Lori (author),O'Beirne\, Maeve (author),White\, Nancy (author),Droppo\, Lisa (author),Foebel\, Andrea (author),Qian\, Gan (author),Nahm\, Sang-Myong (author),Yim\, Odilia (author),McIsaac\, Corrine (author),Jantzi\, Micaela (author)",,2013,Adverse events among Ontario home care clients associated with emergency room visit or hospitalization: a retrospective cohort study,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1510,ir:citationCModel

Methods: A comprehensive literature review was carried out through an electronic database search using Medline\, EMBASE\, PubMED and Google scholar. Results: We identified 17 publications\, comprising 13 evaluated interventions. Of them\, 7 were school-based programs focused on children\, 5 focused on adults\, and 1 included both adults and children. Most interventions aimed at encouraging behaviour change\, especially dietary change\, but did little to address the underlying context of systemic marginalization and colonialism experienced in many Indigenous communities. Interventions focused on improving fitness were more effective than those aimed at dietary change. Overall\, we found a range of successes among these interventions. Those that met with limited success reported that complex social issues and poverty presented challenges to effective intervention work in these communities. Participatory action research methods and community ownership of the intervention were found to be essential for project success. Conclusions: Diabetes-focused intervention research in Indigenous communities appears to be a low priority for Canadian funders and policymakers. More intervention research is urgently needed in these communities. To be effective\, this work must take an approach that is historically deep and sufficiently broad as to enable the ideologic\, policy and institutional changes necessary in order to achieve true equity.

Her reflexive practice allowed for the exploration of perspectives\, biases\, values and knowledge system and therefore it added rigour\, credibility and trustworthiness to both her literature review and clinical work. Although Janet is not a psychotherapist\, her reflexive practice shaped the relationships she developed and influenced the care she provided to people living with diabetic foot ulcers because her therapeutic and community involvement overlapped. Janet’s reflexive practice helped her move beyond the delivery of physical wound care towards more inclusive and expansive relationships with individuals\, communities\, doctors\, psychologists\, and family members. As these collaborative and inclusive relationships developed\, questions about struggles and socio-cultural knowing influenced her understandings and pushed at what she imagined holistic and culturally relevant care might involve. Because her clinical work was geographically located within Aboriginal communities\, her reflexive practice was also informed by the principles of Two-Eyed Seeing. Writing\, journaling\, listening\, conversations and creating ‘art-as-event’ are the strategies which serve as a resource for this paper.

cbu:741,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,Journal of Advanced Nursing--0309-2402,"Aim: The aim of this paper is to review the literature on what facilitates or inhibits continuing education in nursing and to identify ways to make continuing education more effective. Background: Healthcare professionals have always been encouraged to update their knowledge and maintain clinical competence. The rapid changes currently taking place within healthcare systems have increased the pressure from direct care providers\, professional bodies and the general public for nurses to engage in continuing education programmes. Despite a growing body of empirical research on this topic\, the effectiveness and impact of continuing education remains underexplored. Method: A literature search was conducted in January 2005 using CINAHL\, Medline\, the Cochrane databases and the Internet. Keywords used were: 'continuing education'\, 'professional development'\, 'viability of continuing education/professional development programmes'\, 'evaluation of continuing education/professional development programmes' and 'effectiveness of continuing education/professional development programmes'. No date restrictions were imposed. Results: Factors that facilitate the implementation of continuing education in nursing arise from individual\, professional and organizational perspectives. While the philosophy behind continuing education is to encourage nurses to become lifelong learners\, the learning method chosen for such programmes is often didactic in nature\, as opposed to encouraging nurses to take initiative and direct their own learning. Continuing education is intended to ensure healthcare practitioners' knowledge is current\, but it is difficult to determine if those who attend these courses are implementing what they have learnt. Conclusions: To make continuing education programmes more effective\, nurses need to have a more participatory role in their learning. A concerted effort should be made to make continuing education attainable and realistic.",,"cbu:741,citekey: Griscti2006,doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.03940.x,cbu-school: School of Education and Health,cbu-department: Nursing","evaluation,nurses,nursing,continuing education,effectiveness,literature review,of-the-literature,professional development,professional-education","Griscti\, Odette (author),Jacono\, John (author)",,2006,Effectiveness of continuing education programmes in nursing: literature review,,"Text,Journal Article",,,,,1513,ir:citationCModel

Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a))'s impact oil platelet c-AMP levels has never been assessed. Increasing levels of purified human Lp(a) (1-100) mg/dl were incubated with washed but nail platelets. Lp(a) concentrations of 1-25 mg/dl resulted an initial statistically significant increase of platelet c-AMP above basal levels and decreased collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation levels. Higher concentrations progressively returned the platelet c-AMP concentrations to basal levels accompanied by further decreases in platelet aggregation. Increasing concentrations of purified apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)) also resulted in a similar biphasic c-AMP response while Lp(a) without apo(a) was without impact. One antibody directed against apo(a) in intact Lp(a) removed the biphasic c-AMP pattern and eliminated Lp(a) platelet aggregation. Antibodies directed against apo B in intact Lp(a) gave results similar to intact Lp(a) in terms of the biphasic response of c-AMP upon platelet exposure to increasing levels of Lp(a).

Background: Previous studies indicate a number of similarities and differences in the clinical role of nurse educators by country of practice. These include importance assigned to the role\, factors inhibiting/facilitating the role\, means to eliminate barriers to the role\, and perceptions of the ideal role. Design and methods: Data were collected using both quantitative and qualitative strategies. The quantitative phase involved asking all educators to fill in a time log of their academic and clinical activities for a 2-week period. In the qualitative phase\, the first author interviewed five educators\, five nurses and five students about their perceptions of factors which impact the nurse educator's clinical role\, as well as what the ideal clinical role of the nurse educator should be. Findings: Maltese nurse educators allot minimal time to their clinical role. Main reasons cited included workload\, perceived lack of control over the clinical area\, and diminished clinical competence. Nurse educators who frequented the clinical settings (who were either university or joint university and health service employees) where the study took place perceived that employment inequities among the various categories of nurse educators played an important role in the amount of time dedicated by each group to their clinical roles\, and the importance individuals in these groups assigned to that role. The majority of interviewees saw the current role of nurse educators in Malta as preparing students for successful completion of the didactic sections of their programme\, rather than preparing them with all the knowledge and clinical skills necessary to be competent practitioners.

It focuses on Inuit relationships with the Arctic environment\, including hunting knowledge and land skills\, and examines their roles in adaptation to biophysical changes that affect subsistence hunting.

Despite the documented importance of TEK in adaptation and in maintaining a level of competency in subsistence\, the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change are not well defined in the scholarly literature. This paper aims to conceptualize the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change by di-awing on case study research with Inuit in the Canadian Arctic.

While such approaches have been widely advocated\, few have critically examined the tensions and challenges that CBA brings. Responding to this gap\, this article critically examines the use of CBA approaches with Inuit communities in Canada. We suggest that CBA holds significant promise to make adaptation research more democratic and responsive to local needs\, providing a basis for developing locally appropriate adaptations based on local/indigenous and Western knowledge. Yet\, we argue that CBA is not a panacea\, and its common portrayal as such obscures its limitations\, nuances\, and challenges. Indeed\, if uncritically adopted\, CBA can potentially lead to maladaptation\, may be inappropriate in some instances\, can legitimize outside intervention and control\, and may further marginalize communities. We identify responsibilities for researchers engaging in CBA work to manage these challenges\, emphasizing the centrality of how knowledge is generated\, the need for project flexibility and openness to change\, and the importance of ensuring partnerships between researchers and communities are transparent. Researchers also need to be realistic about what CBA can achieve\, and should not assume that research has a positive role to play in community adaptation just because it utilizes participatory approaches.

A novel component was exploring emotion\, well-being\, and travel mode framed by the concept of ""sustainable happiness."" Relationships between travel mode and emotions\, parent perceptions of their child's travel mode on well-being\, and factors related to parent perceptions were examined. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to families (N=5423) from 76 elementary schools. Explanatory variables were demographics (age and sex)\, school travel measures (mode\, distance\, accompaniment by an adult\, safety\, and barriers)\, and emotions (parent and child). Outcomes examined parent perceived benefits of travel mode on dimensions of well-being (physical\, emotional\, community\, and environmental). Descriptive statistics\, chi-square tests and hierarchical regression were used. RESULTS: Parents and children who used AST reported more positive emotions versus passive travelers. Parents of active travelers reported stronger connections to dimensions of well-being. AST had the strongest association with parents' perceptions of their child's well-being\, and positive emotions (parent and child) were also significantly related to well-being on the trip to school.

Thus\, there is a search for new agents that reduce the high costs and risks of polypharmacy while at the same time combatting three or more of the cluster of seven.

Using socio-ecological and population health perspectives\, multiple intervention programming approaches are aimed at providing coordinated and strategic comprehensive programs operating over system levels and across sectors\, allowing practitioners and decision makers to take advantage of synergistic effects. These approaches also require vertical and horizontal (v/h) integration of policy and practice in order to be maximally effective. Discussion: This paper examines v/h integration of interventions for childhood overweight/obesity prevention and reduction from a Canadian perspective. It describes the implications of v/h integration for childhood overweight and obesity prevention\, with examples of interventions where v/h integration has been implemented. An application of a conceptual framework for structuring v/h integration of an overweight/obesity prevention initiative is presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of vertical/horizontal integration for policy\, research\, and practice related to childhood overweight and obesity prevention multiple intervention programs. Summary: Both v/h integration across sectors and over system levels are needed to fully support multiple intervention programs of the complexity and scope required by obesity issues. V/h integration requires attention to system structures and processes. A conceptual framework is needed to support policy alignment\, multi-level evaluation\, and ongoing coordination of people at the front lines of practice.

To date\, most research on the human dimensions of climate change in the Circumpolar North has focused on biophysical issues and their consequences\, such as changing sea ice regimes affecting travel to hunting grounds or the effects of melting permafrost on built infrastructure.

In this paper\, we build upon existing research\, combined with our community-based research and professional mental health practices\, to outline some pathways and mechanisms through which climate change may adversely impact mental health and well-being in the Circumpolar North. Our analysis indicates that mental health may be affected by climate change due to changes to land\, ice\, snow\, weather\, and sense of place; impacts to physical health; damage to infrastructure; indirect impacts via media\, research\, and policy; and through the compounding of existing stress and distress.

Specifically\, we explored how social and institutional discourses shaped power relations and negotiation of patient care. BackgroundCurrent literature indicates that although nurses embrace this notion\, such partnerships are not easily implemented. Most existing studies focus on the role of the nurse as the leader of the partnership with little attention paid to how social and institutional values\, beliefs and practices shape nurse/patient power relations; or how these relationships are negotiated between nurses and patients. DesignThe theoretical and methodological approaches used in this study are based on the precepts of Foucault and feminist poststructural theorists. MethodsIn depth interviews were conducted with eight chronically ill patients and 10 registered nurses. ResultsBoth nurses and patients commented about the relationships that develop between nurses and chronically ill patients and how these relationships facilitate negotiation of patient care. Both parties described challenging moments and how institutional discourses may hinder positive negotiations of care. In this paper we highlight three themes that emerged: getting to know each other\, they are not the sickest patients and finding time to listen. ConclusionsThis study offers an innovative way of unpacking negotiation of care between chronically ill patients and registered nurses. It exposes how social and institutional discourses play a pivotal role in shaping negotiations between nurses and chronically ill patients.

A statistically significant (P < 0.05) linear relationship exists between the amount of PP-protein complex precipitated and the amount of PP added to the reaction mixture. The slope values of these lines indicated the tannin-rich fractions of crude PP extracts to be more effective protein precipitants than the other examined fractions. Based on the amount of gelatin\, fetuin and BSA required to inhibit the formation of the dye-labeled BSA-PP complex by 50%\, gelatin was 4-15 times more effective as a precipitation inhibitor than unlabeled BSA and fetuin.

One hundred twenty-one students attending two high schools were administered one pretest and two posttest questionnaires. Students were arbitrarily assigned to a control or intervention group. The intervention group partook in a 60-minute classroom activity on infant feeding. Findings indicated that students in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater breast-feeding knowledge at Posttest 1 and at 10 weeks postintervention. Students in the intervention group reported a significantly greater intention toward breast-feeding their own future children; an increase was sustained at 10 weeks.

While reactions to Mahama’s killing invite optimism that lynching as a form of instant (in)justice is being problematized in Ghana\, this study leads to a less optimistic position. State\, media and public responses to Mahama’s killing were compared vis-à-vis similar killings of two police officers ‐ Jerry Wornoo and Richard Owusu-Sekyere ‐ in 1998. Drawing on the relevant literature\, this study concluded that a number of factors combined to make Mahama\, Wornoo and Owusu-Sekyere ‘newsworthy victims’. In contrast\, victims in several lynching cases reported by Ghanaian media between 1999 and May 2017 were not deemed newsworthy\, thus attracting less attention. Consequently\, there have been missed opportunities following the Wornoo and Owusu-Sekyere killings to make critical systemic interventions in Ghana to prevent lynching.

This article provides a critical review of current teaching practices of the PTE to high-school students and undergraduate university students. It also provides a new teaching model\, the “periodic universe”\, for understanding of the PTE through building on its foundational periodicity. Students learn through a guided re-creation of the PTE from simple periodic simulations and interdisciplinary processes. The periodic-universe teaching model directs students to conceptualize\, rather than memorize\, relationships between the elements by predicting patterns in progressively challenging simulated worlds. This mixed-method research project consists of both quantitative (n = 58) and qualitative (n = 15) responses from university undergraduate students\, demonstrating the utility of inquiry-based learning of the PTE for novice chemistry students. Herein\, we position the periodic-universe teaching model in the current educational literature of inquiry and interdisciplinary studies by outlining the function of the model and illustrating its effectiveness on the basis of empirical analysis with undergraduate students in a postsecondary-education setting.

Prior to implementing harm reduction programmes\, however\, it is critical to understand how programme users and others in the community perceive the programmes as their perceptions may influence implementation. A mixed-methods study asked PWUS and key informants about their perceptions of implementing five harm reduction programmes in their communities\, including perceptions of the advantages of the programmes\, where best to locate them\, and community support. Questionnaires were administered to 160 PWUS\, and qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 purposefully sampled key informants.

SPSS was used to generate descriptive statistics and means from the quantitative data\, and the qualitative data were analysed for key themes using thematic analysis. Both PWUS and key informants perceived numerous advantages of the harm reduction programmes\, but some key informants suggested that there might be potential opposition to the implementation of additional needle distribution and disposal programmes in some locations and potential opposition to safer consumption sites. Further research is needed to understand why these programmes were viewed as potentially generating opposition\, but findings suggest that a key factor is the association of the programmes with ‘danger’ because the programmes are directly linked with criminalized drug use. In contrast\, the three other programmes are linked to ‘safety’ because naloxone saves lives\, peer navigation programmes support access to existing programmes and detoxification programmes are associated with safety through the reduction/elimination of drug use.

In contrast to predominant explanations about the effect of awards on motivation\, our first multilevel mixed-effect models found that an award within a branch (consisting of ∼30 CHWs) was negatively associated with the performance of the local peers of the winning CHW. Models focused on non-winning branch offices revealed two additional findings. First\, a branch showed underperformance if a CHW from any of the three neighbouring branches won an award in the previous year\, with average monthly performance scores dropping by 27 percentage points. Second\, this negative association was seen only in the top 50th percentile of CHWs. The bottom 50th percentile of CHWs exhibited increased performance by 13 percentage points. These counter-intuitive results suggest that the negative response from high performers might be explained by their frustration of not winning the award or by emotions such as envy and jealousy generated by negative social comparisons.

Although evidence shows that improving gender equality contributes to the achievement of health outcomes\, gender-based constraints faced by CHWs working with social enterprises in Africa have not yet been empirically studied. This study is the first of its kind to address this important gap in knowledge.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted 36 key informant interviews and 21 focus group discussions between 2016 and 2019 (for a total of 175 individuals: 106 women and 69 men) with four health social enterprises in Uganda and Kenya and other related key stakeholders and domain experts. Interview and focus group transcripts were coded according to gender-based constraints and strategies for enhanced performance as well as key sites for intervention.\n\nResults\nWe found that CHW programs can be more gender responsive. We introduce the Gender Integration Continuum for Health Social Enterprises as a tool that can help guide gender equality efforts. Data revealed female CHWs face seven unique gender-based constraints (compared to male CHWs): 1) higher time burden and lack of economic empowerment; 2) risks to personal safety; 3) lack of career advancement and leadership opportunities; 4) lack of access to needed equipment\, medicines and transport; 5) lack of access to capital; 6) lack of access to social support and networking opportunities; and 7) insufficient financial and non-financial incentives.

Neonatal mortality was least in the intervention (1.3%) and highest in the control (13.3%) group\, which was also statistically significant.\n\nConclusion\nour evidence showed that chlorhexidine gel application contributed to the reduction of cord sepsis and neonatal mortality in conflict-affected South Sudan where the majority of births happen at home in unsanitary conditions. Chlorhexidine gel should be added to the essential medicines list in South Sudan and a costed plan for scale-up of chlorhexidine gel application should be developed by the Ministry of Health.",,"cbu:1996,doi: 10.11604/pamj.2021.38.78.21713,https://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/38/78/full,cbu-school: Shannon School of Business,pmid: 33889244,pmcid: PMC8033194",newborn--mortality--infections--chlorhexidine--safe delivery kit,"Draiko\, Christopher Vunni (author),McKague\, Kevin (author),Maturu\, Judith Draleru (author),Joyce\, Sitima (author)",,2021,The effect of umbilical cord cleansing with chlorhexidine gel on neonatal mortality among the community births in South Sudan: a quasi-experimental study,,"Journal Article,Text",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:1996/datastream/PDF/download,1629,ir:citationCModel

Informed by human needs theory\, it situates the new populism in the context of globalization\, economic grievances\, and cultural resentment and backlash against out-groups. Fuelling the rise in support for populism has been growing existential insecurity combined with a lack of effective education on human rights. The outcome\, as shown in countries where populism has come into power\, has been a threat and an attack on the human rights of children\, as described in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. An important means of meeting the challenge of populism\, we contend\, is comprehensive and robust human rights education in schools\, underpinned by education on children’s rights. As called for by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child\, children’s rights education needs to be integrated into school curricula\, policies\, practices\, teaching materials\, and teacher training. Models of human rights education in schools are available and studies have shown positive results in promoting knowledge\, understanding\, and support for human rights.

We study poverty's relationship with non‐farm labour activities in terms of the incidence as well as the intensity and severity of poverty. The study is the first to highlight the contribution of the non‐agricultural sector in the reduction of poverty in the rural areas of Mauritania. We apply probit\, propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting techniques to determine the signs and impacts of participation on poverty reduction. The results show that the probability of being poor is 5.9% lower among households that have at least one member participating in non‐farm activities compared with those only associated with the agriculture sector. Participation in non‐farm activities is associated with lower intensity and severity of poverty (3.6% and 1.9%\, respectively).

They are petrographically diverse with minerals characteristic of both I- and S-type granites\, in some cases within the same intrusion\, and some are compositionally zoned. New LA-ICP-MS ages presented here elucidate the timing and duration of this magmatism. The earliest phase of granitoid magmatism began around 410–405 Ma with the emplacement of the Flagstaff Lake Igneous Complex\, and the presence of contemporaneous mafic rocks suggests that mantle-derived magmas were also produced at this time. Late Devonian ages\, ca. 365 Ma\, for many intrusions\, such as the Chain of Ponds and Songo plutons\, reveal that magmatism continued for 45 million years during which compositionally diverse I- and S-type magmas were produced. In addition\, there is evidence that intrusive activity was prolonged within some plutons\, for example the Rome-Norridgewock pluton and the Mooselookmeguntic Igneous Complex\, with 10–15 myr between intrusive units. The new ages suggest a break in magmatism between 400 Ma and 390 Ma apparently separating Acadian magmatism into early and late pulses. The production of lower crustal I-type magmas appears to have been concentrated later\, ca. 380–365 Ma\, although several S-type granitoids were also emplaced during this period. These Late Devonian plutons display abundant zircon inheritance with ages around 385 Ma\, which suggests that the crust was experiencing enhanced thermal perturbations during this extended timeframe. The new data for granitoid plutons in northwestern Maine are consistent with tectonic models for other parts of Ganderia which propose initial flat slab subduction followed by slab breakoff and delamination.",,"cbu:2003,https://doi.org/10.4138/atlgeol.2021.008,https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/ag/article/view/31381,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Mathematics\, Physics and Geology",,"Gibson\, David (author),Barr\, Sandra M.

Stimulating plant immunity using seaweed extracts is a highly viable strategy\, as these formulations contain many bio-elicitors (phyco-elicitors) which can significantly boost natural plant immunity. Certain bioactive elicitors present in a multitude of extracts of seaweeds (both commercially available and bench-scale laboratory formulations) activate pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) due to their structural similarity (i.e.\, analogous structure) with pathogen-derived molecules. This is achieved via the priming and/or elicitation of the defense responses of the induced systemic resistance (ISR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathways. Knowledge accumulated over the past few decades is reviewed here\, aiming to explain why certain seaweed-derived bioactives have such tremendous potential to elicit plant defense responses with considerable economic significance\, particularly with increasing biotic stress impacts due to climate change and the concomitant move to sustainable agriculture and away from synthetic chemistry and environmental damage. Various extracts of seaweeds display remarkably different modes of action(s) which can manipulate the plant defense responses when applied.

Unique to this form of labor migration is the gendered nature of the phenomenon resulting in men often leaving their wives\, families and rural communities behind for employment opportunities in the oil and gas sectors thousands of kilometers away. As men leave their families and communities for employment\, women who are left behind become primary caregivers to children in addition to also being the primary caretakers of the family home.

This paper examines how labor migration has impacted families and rural communities. Drawing upon focus group\, conversational and key informant interviews with families impacted by mobile labor and practitioners who serve them\, societal perceptions of gendered norms and perceptions of rural life became illuminated. This has contributed to multiple contradictions and role confusion as families adapt and adjust to periods of reunification and separation while striving to remain connected to their rural communities.

We know schools as environments where students attain the knowledge and skills they need for lifelong health and well-being. However\, how do we create healthy schools when our students have\, or are\, experiencing abuse\, neglect and dysfunction? The emotional and behavioural disorders that may be associated with early exposures to trauma\, not only impact the child’s ability to thrive and learn\, but they can also impact their peers\, and the staff in the schools they attend. The attainment of overall school health is influenced if intentional and focused work is not directed towards mitigating the impacts of trauma on our staff and students because it influences brain development\, including executive function\, self-regulation\, baseline physiological arousal levels\, and social-emotional learning and skills development. By addressing these issues\, schools can begin to bring all students closer to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) vision for schools that are Health-Promoting Schools (WHO\, 2009). O’Brien and Howard (2016) developed the concept of Living Schools\, inspired by the Living Campus project at Dawson College\, in Montreal. Dawson College experienced a communal traumatic event in 2006 when a single gunman injured 16 people and killed one student. In the aftermath\, the College created the Living Campus as a restorative and transformative paradigm shift\, grounded in the vision of well-being for all\, sustainability and the reconnection of people and community to nature. The example Dawson College created allows me to wonder if a high school can incorporate the components of Trauma-Informed Practice\, TIP (safety\, the impact of trauma on the brain\, the importance of relationships\, the need to attend to self-regulation and executive functioning skills) (Blaustein & Kinneburgh\, 2010) into the creation of a Living Schools environment. The aim of a trauma-informed classroom\, according to Pickens & Tschopp (2017)\, “is to infuse an understanding of the impact of trauma and adverse life experiences on students into the classroom culture and promote a physically and psychologically safe environment to foster student growth” (p. 1). This research explores the feasibility of utilizing the Living Schools Attributes and Practices Framework (Howard & O’Brien\, 2018) to enrich TIP. Some of the central elements of the Living Schools Framework1 that were explored are a focus on nature and place-based learning\, sustainability education\, and pedagogies that contribute to developing a solution-focused growth mindset\, assisting students to identify and build on their individual strengths and talents\, as well as fostering empathy and compassion for others\, and an improved sense of personal well-being.",,"cbu:1955,cbu-school: School of Education and Health,cbu-department: Education",schools--school setting--living school--education,"Kpnschuh\, Michele (author),O'Brien\, Catherine (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2020,"Utilizing the living schools philosophy\, to enhance trauma-informed practice in a high school setting",,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:1955/datastream/PDF/download,1660,ir:thesisCModel

Mag.--0016-7568--1469-5081,"The Flowers River Igneous Suite of north-central Labrador comprises several discrete peralkaline granite ring intrusions and their coeval volcanic succession. The Flowers River Granite was emplaced into Mesoproterozoic-age anorthosite–mangerite–charnockite–granite (AMCG) -affinity rocks at the southernmost extent of the Nain Plutonic Suite coastal lineament batholith. New U–Pb zircon geochronology is presented to clarify the timing and relationships among the igneous associations exposed in the region. Fayalite-bearing AMCG granitoids in the region record ages of 1290 ± 3 Ma\, whereas the Flowers River Granite yields an age of 1281 ± 3 Ma. Volcanism occurred in three discrete events\, two of which coincided with emplacement of the AMCG and Flowers River suites\, respectively. Shared geochemical affinities suggest that each generation of volcanic rocks was derived from its coeval intrusive suite. The third volcanic event occurred at 1271 ± 3 Ma\, and its products bear a broad geochemical resemblance to the second phase of volcanism. The surrounding AMCG-affinity ferrodiorites and fayalite-bearing granitoids display moderately enriched major- and trace-element signatures relative to equivalent lithologies found elsewhere in the Nain Plutonic Suite. Trace-element compositions also support a relationship between the Flowers River Granite and its AMCG-affinity host rocks\, most likely via delayed partial melting of residual parental material in the lower crust. Enrichment manifested only in the southernmost part of the Nain Plutonic Suite as a result of its relative proximity to multiple Palaeoproterozoic tectonic boundaries.

Darwin had earned a reputation as a sober and careful scientist\, but opponents of his fully naturalistic theory which implied humans had evolved from an earlier form of ape criticized his method for setting up unproven hypotheses. Darwin’s method they objected was not that of careful Baconian inductivism\, according to which one is supposed to simply collect the facts\, allowing them to speak for themselves and to eschew hypotheses.\n\nHow did these debates about Darwinism and the theory of evolution play out in places far from the metropole of the British Empire?

The Acadian community of Cap Rouge was removed to serve the tourism-hungry government at the time. Many aspects and influences caused this removal when building the park\, such as the government's tourist agenda and Nova Scotia's need for an identity. \nThis thesis contains the different oral histories of Cap Rouge. Participants were interviewed in person and shared information on what they witnessed or heard from others. The participants were asked the same questions to gain a consensus on what Cap Rouge was like before\, during and after the expropriation. This study is primarily focused on their oral histories. A timeline of events that happened pre-expropriation explains the park's reasoning for the removal. This timeline will be used to help understand the buildup that led to the expropriation and what happened after. From this research\, the removal of Cap Rouge is significant for the new cultural identity within Nova Scotia during the 1930s.",Cap Rouge,"cbu:2094,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: ""Literature\, Folklore & The Arts""","Parks Canada--Acadian,Parks Canada--Acadian--Cap Rouge","Musick\, Charlotte (author),Parish\, Joseph (Thesis advisor),Brodie\, Ian (Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2023,Loss of a community: Cap Rouge and the formation of a new cultural identity,,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2094/datastream/PDF/download,1673,ir:thesisCModel

Despite millions in investment\, Western-trained scientists\, engineers\, and other researchers as well as the government agencies that have constitutionally-mandated fiduciary responsibilities to address such issues have been rather unsuccessful in solving them. This has been due\, in large part\, to an overreliance on methods of Western science and management\, ignoring the vast place-based wisdom of Indigenous knowledge systems and relational practices regarding water found across the country. The underlying reasons for this partiality are not innocuous; entrenched colonial and racist policies\, programs\, and practices have persisted across time and space. In recent years\, there is increasing recognition of the importance of applying Indigenous approaches to water challenges in Canada. But strategies for successful implementation are only beginning to emerge. In an attempt to respond to this knowledge gap\, our research has sought to systematically identify and assess how both Indigenous and Western ontologies\, epistemologies\, and methodologies have been implemented in water research and management.

cbu:1889,,info:fedora/cbu:faculty-works,,,,,,,"""A brutal murder in a small Maritime fishing community raises urgent questions of right and wrong\, and even the nature of good and evil\, in this masterfully told true story. In June 2013\, three upstanding citizens of a small Cape Breton town cold-bloodedly murdered their neighbour\, Phillip Boudreau\, at sea. While out checking their lobster traps\, two Landry cousins and skipper Dwayne Samson saw Boudreau in his boat\, the Midnight Slider\, about to vandalize their lobster traps. Like so many times before\, Boudreau was about to cost them thousands of dollars out of their seasonal livelihood. One man took out a rifle and fired four shots at Boudreau and his boat. To finish the job\, they rammed their own larger boat over the top of his speedbat. Boudreau's body was never found. Then they completed the day's fishing and went home to Petit de Grat on Isle Madame.\nBoudreau was a Cape Breton original--an inventive small-time criminal who had terrorized and entertained Petit de Grat for two decades. He had been in prison for nearly half his adult life. He was funny and frightening\, loathed\, loved\, and feared. One neighbour says he would ""steal the beads off Christ's moccasins""--then give the booty away to someone in need. He would taunt his victims\, and threaten them with arson if they reported him. He was accused of one attempted rape. Meanwhile the police and the Fisheries officers were frustrated\, cowed\, and hobbled by shrinking budgets. Boudreau seemed invincible\, a miscreant who would plague the village forever. Cameron\, a resident of the area since 1971\, argues that the Boudreau killing was a direct reaction to credible and dire threats that the authorities were powerless to neutralize. As many local people have said\, if those fellows hadn't killed him\, someone else would have.\nLike Say Nothing\, The Perfect Storm\, The Golden Spruce\, and Into Thin Air\, this book offers a dramatic narrative set in a unique\, lovingly drawn setting\, where a story about one small community has universal resonance. This is a story not about lobster\, but about the grand themes of power and law\, security and self-respect. It raises a disturbing question: Are there times when taking the law into your own hands is not only understandable but the responsible thing to do?""--\nPublisher",,"cbu:1889,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,https://cbu.novanet.ca/permalink/01NOVA_CBU/2g2bfj/alma990066034790107189,isbn: 9780735238053",murder--Nova Scotia--Petit-de-Grat--biography,"Cameron\, Silver Donald (author)",Viking Canada,2020,Blood in the Water,,"Text,Book\, Whole",,,,,1702,ir:citationCModel

Shifting food systems is one of humanity's biggest challenge and greatest opportunity. Adaptable and health promoting plant-based diets are explored in this collection\, which by their nature support nourishing environmental\, social\, ethical\, political\, and economic outcomes. In this book detailed descriptions are provided of what constitutes a healthy plant-based diet and active lifestyle. Readers are invited to engage with a community of practitioners delving more deeply into strategies for transitioning societies to greater succulence and sustainability. Throughout the first section of the book\, environmental challenges and opportunities for reversing climate change are highlighted as our most urgent action. The focus then turns to global food systems and the intersections that are undermining human and animal health. The final section offers preventative approaches and encourages reorienting systems of law\, economics and education to exemplify integrity\, coordination\, coherence and compassion. This book will be of interest to students and academics\, as well as policy professionals in all fields engaging with complex issues and systems analyses. It will be of value to those working in health services\, policy development\, agriculture\, economic development\, and social change as it provides steps to enhance well-being\, pathways to increase jobs in the green economy\, and practical ideas to reverse greenhouse gas emissions""",,"cbu:1795,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: L'nu\, Political\, and Social Studies,cbu-department: Humanities,https://cbu.novanet.ca/permalink/01NOVA_CBU/hsp1n5/alma990058580490107189",,"Terry\, Gibbs (author),Harris\, Tracey (author)",,,The vegan challenge is a democracy issue: Citizenship and the living world,,"Text,Book\, Section",,,,,1708,ir:citationCModel

Iron can participate in both critical (i.e. hemoglobin formation) and dangerous (i.e. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation) processes. When there is an increase in the labile iron pool\, iron can readily catalyze Fenton Reactions\, resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species which can lead to oxidative stress. In the Fenton Reaction\, Fe2+ is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from the mitochondria\, generating hydroxide ions and hydroxyl radicals\, which are potent\, non-selective oxidizing agents that react with biomolecules\, such as DNA\, amino acids\, proteins and lipids. Lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction\, initiated by the Fenton Reaction\, that can eventually lead to cell death. Excess labile iron can result from various diseases\, such as hemochromatosis and thalassemia. Chelators can be used in the treatment of these diseases because they remove iron from solution\, thus preventing the Fenton Reaction\, and consequently lipid peroxidation. Using an arachidonic acid model\, this polyunsaturated fatty acid was exposed to both Fe3+ and Fenton Reaction conditions (i.e.\, Fe3+ and H2O2)\, to induce lipid peroxidation. The arachidonic acid model was also exposed to iron chelators (i.e. DIBI and deferiprone) to assess their ability to supress lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde (MDA)\, a stable by-product of lipid peroxidation\, was used to quantify oxidative stress using a thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay. In the TBARS assay\, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reacts with MDA to form a TBA-MDA chromogen. However\, in the arachidonic acid model\, increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide reduced the fluorescence signal from the TBA-MDA chromogen. The Fenton Reaction interferes with the TBARS assay because the colorimetric dye appears to be degraded by the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Fe3+ was sufficient to induce lipid peroxidation in arachidonic acid and was subsequently used in all experiments. Iron chelators\, i.e.\, deferiprone and DIBI\, a polymeric iron chelator\, were used to inhibit lipid peroxidation. The multidentate chelator DIBI was more effective at reducing Fe3+ induced lipid peroxidation in an in vitro arachidonic acid model.",,"cbu:2084,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology",,"Nicholson\, Amanda (author),Shine\, Xu (Thesis advisor),Oakes\, Ken (Thesis advisor),Beresford\, Rod (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2019,The Role of Iron Chelators in Reducing Lipid Peroxidation,,Text,,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2084/datastream/PDF/download,1741,ir:thesisCModel

G has the lowest redox potential among all native nucleotides\, making the structure prone to oxidative damage\, generating several guanine base lesions\, including the most common one called 8-oxoguanine. However\, the function and the role of this system are not clear. To have more insight into the activity and consequences of oxidative DNA damage in vivo\, understanding the oxidative mechanism of hemin-G-quadruplexes in vitro is vital. Experiments with G4s and varying [H2O2] with chromogenic substrates such as 3\,3'\,5\,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)\, 2\,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) TMB and ABTS oxidation show that the catalytic activity of G4s is significant. To test which reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the main species generated in the system\, different experiments with selective probes and trapping agents were done. The result supports the hypothesis of singlet oxygen is the main intermediate species. This discovery is critical as it enhances our knowledge of the impact of oxidative damage on local and regional DNA structures and neighboring biomolecules\, potentially discovering treatments for subsequent mutations or carcinogenesis due to the selectivity of this ROS to 8-oxoguanine.",,"cbu:2070,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Chemistry",,"\, Ngoc Pham (Jane) (author),Zhang\, Xu (Thesis advisor),MacInnis\, Judy (Thesis advisor),Oakes\, Ken (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2022,Reactive Oxygen Species Induced by DNA-heme-based G-Quadruplex Structures with Hydrogen Peroxide: Insights into Oxidative DNA Damage,,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2070/datastream/PDF/download,1745,ir:thesisCModel

There is an annual survey of Atlantic cod within the Northwestern Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) 4Vn (i.e.\, Sydney Bight) Division. This study uses the data collection from the Atlantic Cod Sentinel Survey from 1995- 2019 to study the condition and abundance of Atlantic cod within 4Vn throughout the years of the survey\, along with the change in abundance of recorded bycatch. Additionally\, discussions\nwith fisheries management professionals were conducted to gauge the industry’s protocols and impressions on the decision-making and policy implementation approach with regards to the fisheries. This study recorded drastic declines in cod as well as the majority of bycatch species. Atlantic halibut was an outlier and showed a tremendous increase over the study period. The condition of the cod caught within 4Vn was observed using Fulton K\, HSI\, and GSI indices. HSI and GSI appear to correlate and both are trending upwards within the last few years. Fulton K expressed poor cod body condition consistently since 2002. Research demonstrates that Atlantic cod are sensitive to temperature and that the amalgamation of overfishing and\nanthropogenic climate change could have devastating consequences on the species.

Current detection protocols include testing a single gill section for parasite presence using DNA analysis followed by confirmation of infection through histological examination. The presence of localized infections may go undetected using standard DNA analysis protocols resulting in false negative test results. The testing of additional samples could allow for the detection of localized infections\, but would require more time\, labour\, and expenses\, thus this approach would only be worth implementing if it detects a greater number of infections than the current protocol. This study involved using two different methods\nfor analysis of tissues: (i) analysis of four additional samples from oysters previously tested using standard protocols\, and (ii) analysis of samples from homogenized oysters previously tested using standard protocols. The results of this study suggest that the standard protocol does not detect all infections and a more thorough sampling/testing protocol may be more reliable for detecting the presence of the parasite.

Appealing to empirical research to ground its philosophical analysis\, the theory presented in this book establishes that cultivating self-confidence through self-defense training is a significant strategy contributing to resistance and resilience under threats of violence and hence\, autonomy development."" -- Publisher's description",,"cbu:2089,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: humanities,https://cbu.novanet.ca/permalink/01NOVA_CBU/2g2bfj/alma9970596338607189,isbn: 9781498578851",,"Burrow\, Sylvia (author)",Lanham : Lexington Books,2022,"Gender Violence: Resistance\, Resilience and Autonomy",,"Text,Book\, Whole",,,,,1756,ir:citationCModel

Including contributions written by LIS professionals and scholars\, the book demonstrates that although many libraries do well at attending to users and managing external information they often fail at taking care of their own employees and addressing internal workplace issues. Acadia and the contributing authors explore the problem of dysfunctional libraries so that the LIS profession can come to terms with the systemic dysfunction in their institutions and begin solution-oriented and change-positive progress toward new and sustainable functionality. The book analyses the dysfunctional nature of modern libraries\, while simultaneously proposing solutions to reduce and alleviate dysfunction. Through theory and application\, it takes an explicit practice-based approach with the intent to inform and explain dysfunction as experienced in the library workplace at individual and structural levels and perspectives. Libraries as Dysfunctional Organizations and Workplaces brings the dysfunction discourse to the attention of LIS academics and scholars\, so that further theoretical and empirical research can proceed from and subsequently be addressed in library and information schools.

This is of concern as it relates to childhood obesity rates\, diabetes and at risk factors for cardiovascular disease; statistics in all of these areas are trending upwards. There is a growing body of research to support plant-based diets to interrupt these trends. A qualitative research study was completed to: A) understand the perspectives of school administrators\, head of schools\, teachers\, food service staff and support staff regarding school community receptiveness to plant-based options; B) to understand the awareness of the connection of plant-based choices to affordability and better human and planetary health outcomes; and C) to understand the existence of food service cooking skills\, menu planning knowledge and abilities with plant-based ingredients. The research question was the following: how might school food culture be shifted to incorporate sustainable plant-rich menu planning while learning to improve human\, and planetary well-being? The Chronic Care Model frames the study because it focuses on improving health outcomes for people at risk for chronic disease. Using the SWOT  categories: strengths\, weaknesses\, opportunities and threats\, data were entered into one of the four categories. The researcher spent considerable time reflecting on the data\, repeatedly reviewing the literature and then analyzing the data in effort to identify overarching themes and subsequently create a prioritized list of SWOT strategies that could be implemented by the schools. Themes and strategies were then discussed with participants to verify and to allow them to recommend changes. This process was slow and deliberate in efforts to end up with prioritized strategies that were practical\, and usable SWOT strategies that supported the Chronic Care Model approach. A demographic questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from seven school personnel participants from two private schools in Nova Scotia. Participants were able to review summarized research themes and strategies by email for practicability and relevance to school environments. SWOT findings revealed 27 core themes which were carefully analyzed to create 15 strategies to put research findings into action. Strategies included: the creation of a school cooks’ network\, local bulk food ordering partnerships\, internal plant-based expert lists\, school culture cookbook\, school menu input forms\, plant-based cooking kits\, partnering students with school cooks for food skills development\, mystery food boxes\, an electronic plant-based file\, plant-based guest speaker/field trip lists\, school and cafeteria plant-based policies\, class/family plant-based challenges\, plant-based newsletters/posters to source grant opportunities and to track plate waste of vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals.

In recent years\, controversy has risen over whether increased working memory skills may be resulting from bilingualism in particular. The current study aimed to address two limitations implemented in previous studies: testing bilingual participants on verbal working memory tasks in their second language\, and failing to take factors such as frequency of language usage and code-switching (i.e.\, the ability to switch between two or more language in a single conversation) into consideration. Two groups of bilingual participants were implemented: those who spoke English as a first language and displayed a low frequency of second-language usage\, and those who spoke English as a second language and displayed a higher frequency of second-language usage. While comparing these groups to monolingual controls\, it was concluded that the verbal requirements associated with verbal working memory tasks may have been possibly “hiding” evidence for a bilingual advantage in those tested in their second language. In contrast\, evidence for a bilingual advantage was found for the group tested in their first language. This effect was not observed while comparing groups on a nonverbal working memory task\, suggesting that this type of task may more accurately represent the bilingual advantage in various groups of bilinguals.",,"cbu:2071,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Psychology",,"Brogan\, Victoria (author),Robertson\, Erin (Thesis advisor),Schmidt\, Heather (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2022,The bilingual advantage of working memory: does it depend on the context of second language learning?,,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2071/datastream/PDF/download,1762,ir:thesisCModel

The act of music performance can also lead to someone feeling a variety of positive and/or negative emotions that may be interacting with MPA. Although we typically think of anxiety as being debilitative\, there are times where anxiety can facilitate better performance. In this study we aim to gain a greater understanding of how MPA\, emotions\, and context\, influence the music performance experience and how these variables may contribute to a musician perceiving their anxiety as facilitating or debilitating. Our sample (n = 114) consisted of musicians that had experience in one or more of the four performance contexts. Participants took a web survey where they filled out measures of MPA and PANAS regarding each context they had experience with and indicated whether they felt their MPA made their performance better or worse. 2x2 ANOVAs found that MPA was significantly higher in solo performance compared to group performance\, as well as significantly higher in group rehearsal compared to group performance. A correlational analysis found that participants who reported higher MPA within every context also reported higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions. T-tests revealed that participants that reported higher MPA were also significantly more likely to deem their MPA as being debilitative across all the contexts. Based on these results\, it appears that facilitative and debilitative MPA\, emotions\, and context may work together to create unique emotion schemas that are not easily measured or defined.",,"cbu:2072,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Psychology",,"Murphy\, Emily N.

I specifically asked: 1) Is the breadth of prey exploited by E. heros representative of prey availability?; 2) Does a moonsnail’s diet change across its ontogeny?; 3) Do moonsnails differentiate between different sizes of prey within a given species?; 4) Do moonsnails display site selectivity in where they drill their prey?; And 5) Does a predator of a given size produce the same borehole across prey taxa differing in shell thickness and composition. I addressed these objectives through beach collections of drilled and undrilled shells\, and laboratory experiments to determine the relationship between borehole diameter and moonsnail size across prey species. Field evidence indicated that moonsnails have a broad diet consisting of 13 bivalve and 7 gastropod species\, with some variation across locations based on prey availability. Larger moonsnails produced larger boreholes than smaller snails in laboratory experiments and\, since this relationship did not vary across prey species examined\, I used borehole diameters to assess ontogenetic changes in diet. With increasing size\, moonsnails changed from a diet dominated by Soft-shelled Clams (Mya arenaria)\, Carpenter Tellins (Tellina carpenteri) and Gem Clams (Gemma gemma) to one focused on larger prey taxa including Atlantic Surfclams (Spisula solidissima) and conspecifics. In addition to the fact that larger predators tended to feed on larger prey items\, larger snails also selected a wider range of prey sizes than smaller snails. Cost-benefit analysis showed that moonsnails may select prey based on energetic reward per\nunit drill time\, although size constraints in handling prey also appear to strongly influence prey selection. Analysis of borehole site selection revealed that boreholes were frequently drilled in one particular area near the umbo in three bivalve species\, but there was no preference for drilling one valve over the other. Borehole site selection was highly consistent within gastropod prey species as well\, although the specific area selected varied among species. Through field surveys and lab experiments\, I was able to demonstrate that E. heros has a broad diet of bivalves and gastropods\, which is representative of prey availability\, and changes across ontogeny. I have established that this naticid is size selective in the choice of its prey and is also selective in allocating drilling to a particular area of the prey shell. I have also determined that E. heros’ boreholes are consistent across different prey taxa.

Extreme discharge regimes re-distribute streambed substrates by erosional processes during higher discharges and depositional processes of previously suspended particles during low-flow conditions. Due to their need for various sized substrates during freshwater early life-stages\, climate-mediated extreme discharge regimes can exert detrimental impacts on early life-stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)(Finstad et al.\, 2011). The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of discharge extremes on the habitat of early life-stage of Atlantic salmon within Clyburn Brook in Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Potential impacts were evaluated by re-assessing habitats over various periods of time and using hydraulic computational software (HEC-RAS) to predict the discharge required to cause the observed morphological alterations. Biota density (Atlantic salmon\, EPT (Ephemeroptera\, Plecoptera\, and Trichoptera) benthic invertebrates) were correlated with changes in habitat variables to infer changes in habitat quality over time. The results provide evidence that high discharge regimes influence early life stage Atlantic salmon recruitment directly (via mass displacement) and indirectly (via habitat losses through bed load transport and loss of habitat heterogeneity) as biota abundance negatively correlated with a decline in streambed heterogeneity over time. However\, the effects of low flow regimes were inconclusive due to anomalously wet summer 2023 conditions. Hydraulic computational models provided evidence that bed stability decreased from 2008-2021\, indicating that in-stream morphological alterations may become more substantial as climate-mediated precipitation patterns continue to escalate\, which may decrease habitat availability for juvenile Atlantic salmon in Clyburn Brook.",,"cbu:2125,cbu-school: School of Science and Technology,cbu-department: Biology",Atlantic Salmon--Salmo salar,"Roland\, Josh (author),Oakes\, Ken (Thesis advisor),Zhang\, Xu (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2024,Extreme discharge influences on freshwater habitat of early life stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and associated recruitment disturbances,CC-BY,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2125/datastream/PDF/download,1789,ir:thesisCModel

The current research gathered five gender diverse participants and one participant representing the BScN (Bachelor of Science\, Nursing) program at Cape Breton University\, and used qualitative research methods\, including Grounded Theory (Rennie\, 2000) to understand different perspectives on how gender diverse people feel about healthcare providers regarding gender affirmation and general health. Gender diverse interviewees expressed feelings ranging from fear to dissatisfaction when dealing with healthcare providers\, and while at times the BScN was able to partially validate these perspectives\, there were moments when they were out of sync\, notably that gender diverse patients should be responsible for educating their healthcare providers. The five themes that emerged from the thematic analysis include (1) Not feeling supported by uneducated\, unwelcoming healthcare providers\, (2) Feeling scared and uncomfortable to open up to healthcare providers to the point where any medical care is avoided\, (3) Current need for self-advocacy\,  (4) Poor access to information for both gender diverse adults and healthcare providers\, and (5) The solution is that doctors need to be willing to make a concerted effort to educate themselves and to learn from gender diverse people (while not expecting their own patients to have to educate them).",,"cbu:2140,cbu-school: School of Arts and Social Sciences,cbu-department: Psychology",gender affirming care,"MacDonald\, Marco (author),Schmidt\, Heather (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2024,A Qualitative Exploration into the Quality of Gender Affirming Healthcare in Nova Scotia,,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2140/datastream/PDF/download,1802,ir:thesisCModel

This mixed methods study uses perceptions of prior and ongoing pandemic work experiences in Alberta high schools to explore administrators’ influence on workplace culture through the research question: How has leadership’s response to shifting work conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted school culture in Alberta high schools? For quantitative data\, 17 Alberta high school teachers and administrators responded to a Likert-type survey\, and a subset of four were selected through combined purposive and convenience sampling for an interview to gather qualitative data. Both data sets revealed themes of increased levels of stress and decreased levels of workplace satisfaction for both teachers and administrators\, with a shift to relying on support from outside of the workplace. While communication patterns remained stable when comparing prior and ongoing pandemic conditions (i.e.\, effective communication patterns stayed effective; ineffective communication patterns stayed ineffective)\, trust in leadership broadly diminished for teachers during the pandemic\, while self-efficacy increased for both administrators and teachers as solutions to emergent issues were found. With a preference for unstructured\, spontaneous\, and as-needed support within the workplace\, there was a strong indication that pre-existing relationships were the most significant source of sustainable well-being in the workplace for teachers and administrators. While staff flexibility was essential to surviving the multi-factorial impacts of the pandemic\, effective\, predictable communication patterns and meaningful\, authentic relationships were pre-existing conditions that played an important role in sustaining Alberta administrators and teachers during unprecedented times.",Alberta,"cbu:2145,cbu-school: School of Education and Health,cbu-department: Education","COVID-19--workplace culture,COVID-19--workplace culture--Alberta","Ossowska\, Ania (author),LeVatte\, Lynn (Thesis advisor),(Supervisory Committee Member),(Examination Committee Member)",Cape Breton University,2024,Leadership Response to COVID-19: Impacts on Workplace Culture in Alberta Schools,,"Text,Dissertation/Thesis",,,,https://cbufaces.cairnrepo.org/islandora/object/cbu:2145/datastream/PDF/download,1803,ir:thesisCModel

Using critical theory and fat studies as the theoretical framework\, this phenomenological and autoethnographical study explores the experiences of fat educators and adults who are reflecting on their time within the school system when they were students living in a larger body.

The analysis uncovered four themes that were central to the experience of the participants: (1) the effects of minority stress are unique and chronic\, (2) the worth and value of a person is seen in their outward body appearance\, (3) the impact of marginalization and stigmatization by others with thin privilege is seen in both practice and policy\, and (4) allyship and justified anger are necessary to effect change. Participants shared their experiences of being in a large body as students and as educators\, and the ongoing social injustice that they frequently face.

This freshwater mussel cannot complete its lifecycle without White Perch. Density and age demographics of Yellow Lampmussel in Blacketts Lake were estimated by quadrat sampling to assess the impact of Chain Pickerel and examine the need of translocation to prevent the extirpation of this at-risk population. I carried out a pilot translocation within Blacketts Lake\, and developed criteria to identify and assess potential recipient lakes for translocated mussels based on habitat suitability and fish host availability. The average mussel density in Blacketts Lake was 1.9(±0.45SE)/m2. The oldest age class was 20 years and the youngest was 7\, indicating no recent recruitment has occurred within the last 7 years. Mussels responded well to being moved within the lake with all burrowing in sediment and resuming normal activity within 24 hours; no mortality occurred.

B. gauderio produce a weakly electric signal\,\nreferred to as an electric organ discharge (EOD)\, for habitat navigation and communication with\nconspecifics. The EOD displays sexual dimorphism\, circadian regulation\, and is highly\nenergetically expensive. While both sexes of B. gauderio exhibit larger signals in the\nnighttime compared to the daytime\, males exhibit a much larger signal increase in the nighttime.\nThis enhanced nighttime EOD requires a large portion of a male’s energy budget to EOD\nproduction.

The stories we hear impact the\nways we see the world and therefore it is necessary to ensure inclusion of perspectives that\nchallenge the dominant narratives\, which perpetuate colonial harm. As a public school\nteacher\, eager to engage in education for reconciliation\, I have noticed many colleagues\nexpress a hesitation to engage in topics such as treaty education\, decolonial education\, and\nIndigenizing a classroom. It has become clear to me that it is necessary for settler teachers\nto confront their positions in the story of colonization so they can move past that hesitancy.\nMy research was intended to explore the question\, how can non-Indigenous educators\nconfront their positions in the story of Canada’s colonial history and participate in\neducation for reconciliation? I interviewed members of the Interchurch Council for\nHydropower\, an advocacy group consisting mostly of non-Indigenous activists advocating\nfor northern communities in Manitoba impacted by hydro development. The non-\nIndigenous participants shared their experiences of shifting from a settler mindset to one\nthat was able to confront their positions in the story of colonization.
