msvu:6302,,info:fedora/msvu:insight,,,,,,,"This issue of Insight recaps the fifty years that have passed. The history was written by different authors and each segment ahs its own distinct viewpoint and style. Sister Marie Agnes begins the story and tells it from the standpoint of one who has lived as well as taught at the Mount for many years. Dr. Lillian Wainwright takes up the story next and presents it from a faculty viewpoint. Sister Mary Albertus finished the three-part story by projecting into the future\, and her tone is that of a newly appointed chief administrator\, the president. Then we have two bonuses: Sister Agnes Martha Westwater changes the mood again as she deals with twilight figured in the Mount's history\, and Mrs. Valerie Cowan describes the campus as it was years ago. And then\, because this issue is about the Mount over the years\, we've added ""then and now"" pictures and reminded our readers about the Mount's motto and crest (taken from the back of the issue).

msvu:6303,,info:fedora/msvu:insight,,,,,,,"""Women in Education"" was the title of the symposium held to mark the installation of Sister Mary Albertus and to begin the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Mount. It also seems to be the theme of this issue of Insight because so much of the material is about or pertains to women in education. The three outstanding women who participated in the symposium (Dr. Jill Conway\, Dr. May Diaz\, and Miss Sylva Gelber) contributed the first article which is an edited transcript of their remarks that day. ""Service Response to Need"" is Sister Mary Albertus' installation address. It is written by a woman who has spent her adult life educating other women\, and\, as a document about this university\, it concerns the further education of women. There is a series of pictures taken the day of Sister Albertus' installation and a brief report on that day. Another brief account deals with the renewal of the Mount Saint Vincent Dalhousie agreement. Student Barbara Purdy reports on the research Assistant Professor Marial Mosher has been conducting concerning Canadian Indians. Dr. Philip McShane describes five types of philosophy in the Current Issues section. Alumnae-Development officer Jean Flemming has compiled this issue's ""Spilt Ink"" and the Mount personality featured is Dr. Pierre Gerin (taken from the back of the issue).",,msvu:6303,,Mount Saint Vincent University.
